The widely used Logit model is dependent on the assumption that the utility items are independent, violating this assumption caused inconsistent parameter estimations and biased predictions. To improve the prediction accuracy of mode choice, this paper employs the data fusion model based on stacking strategy and proposes a hybrid model of the unsupervised Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) combining with the supervised Random Forest (RF). A variety of features that may impact mode choice behavior are ranked and selected by using the feature selection algorithms. The proposed model, which is particularly useful and powerful in the choice behavior analysis and outperforms other widely used classifiers, is verified by travel diary data from Germany and Switzerland.

	abstract = {Discrete choice modeling is a fundamental part of travel demand forecasting. To date, this field has been dominated by parametric approaches (e.g., logit models), but non-parametric approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) possess much potential since choice problems can be assimilated to pattern recognition problems. In particular, ANN models are easily applicable with the higher capability to identify nonlinear relationships between inputs and designated outputs to predict choice behaviors. This article investigates the capability of four types of ANN models and compares their prediction performance with a conventional multinomial logit model (MNL) for mode choice problem. The four ANN are: Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Clustered PNN. To compare the modeling techniques, we present algorithmic differences of each ANN technique, and we assess their prediction accuracy with 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, we assess the contribution of explanatory variables by conducting sensitivity analyses on significant variables. The results show that ANN models outperform MNL, with prediction accuracies around 80\% compared to 70\% for MNL. Moreover, PNN performs best out of all ANN, especially to predict underrepresented modes.},

	abstract = {The article describes the development of the Sustainable Urban Transport Index (SUTI) for cities in the Asia-Pacific region. The first step was designing a conceptual framework based on literature on sustainable development and transport while incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of relevance for urban transport planning. The second step was to identify and select indicators for the index using literature, indicator criteria, and input from an expert group meeting. This led to a consolidated list of ten indicators. The final step was to construct the index itself. This involved decisions on ways to normalize, weigh and calculate the elements of the index. The resulting Second regional expert meeting expert endorsed the refined index with ten indicators and agreed for pilot application of SUTI in selected Asian cities. It is also recognized that additional work on data collection and analysis will be required to apply SUTI and regularly report and compare the performance of urban transport systems in cities in practice. The application of SUTI in four pilot cities is ongoing with preliminary results used for illustration. It is hoped that SUTI would be a useful tool to evaluate and assess the state of urban transportation systems in Asian cities. The analysis of urban transport systems would provide useful insights into policy suggestions and actions required for improving urban transport system and services. The SUTI would help measure progress in improving urban transport and contribute to the achievement of SDG target 11.2 on improving public transport in urban areas.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our cities in monumental ways with no sector likely being more severely impacted than transport. Lockdowns, physical spacing, transport restrictions and stay-at-home guidelines have transformed personal mobility and highlighted the mistakes of an unbalanced pro-car culture that deﬁned a century of urban planning. One immediate effect of the virus in relation to travel demand and supply was the emergence of active travel modes because of their unique ability to provide a socially distanced way of transport. Cycling is one of the modes that has enjoyed signiﬁcant attention. Numerous cities have reallocated street and public space to cyclists and introduced pro-bike interventions like pop-up cycle lanes, e-bike subsidies, free bike-share use and trafﬁc calming measures. This newly found outbreak-induced momentum creates an opportunity to establish a new ethos that allows the promotion of potentially permanent strategies that may help cycling to be (re-)established as a robust, mainstream and resilient travel mode for inner city trips and not as a second-class alternative operating under the automobile’s giant shadow. This paper provides a state-of-the-art description of the anti-COVID cycling-friendly initiatives that have been introduced globally, the successes and failures of these initiatives, the lessons learnt that can help us redeﬁne the bicycle’s role in local societies today and a best cycling practice policy guide for planning a more bike-centric future.},

	abstract = {Research linking bikeway infrastructure and cycling levels has increased signiﬁcantly over the last 20 years — with the strongest growth since 2010. The research has evolved from the study of lanes and paths, to include analyses of the role of intersection treatments, and ﬁnally to studies that attempt to measure the whole bike network. Most studies suggest a positive relationship between bikeway networks or aspects of the network and cycling levels. Stated and revealed-preference studies suggest a hierarchy of cyclist and non-cyclist preferences may exist, favoring separate paths and/or lanes over cycling on roadways with trafﬁc — particularly with high volumes of fast-moving motorized trafﬁc. Revealed- and stated-route-choice studies indicate that intersections have negative effects on the cycling experience, but that certain features can offset this. The research correlating link and node characteristics to cycling implies that networks of such facilities would have positive effects, though very few empirical studies link complex measures of the network to cycling levels. In spite of an increase in studies and general agreement among ﬁndings, several important research gaps remain, including empirical studies using comprehensive network measures and studies of speciﬁc facility designs and new types of facilities (including intersection treatments). Improved research methods are necessary, including better sampling, longitudinal studies, greater geographic diversity, and incorporating more control variables, including policies.},

Another finding is that the success of the transition depends on the stabilization of the emerging regime that will trigger upscaling in terms of the numbers of adopters.

Planners base their recommendations on a substantial body of research that examines the impact of compact development on driving. Different studies, however, have found different outcomes: Some studies find that compact development causes people to drive less, while other studies do not. I use meta-regression analysis to a) explain why different studies on driving and compact development yield different results, and b) combine different findings from many studies into reliable statistics that can better inform planning practice. I address the following questions: Does compact development make people drive less, and if so, how much less? I find that compact development does make people drive less, because most of the compact development features I study have a statistically significant negative influence on driving. The impact, however, is fairly small: Compact development features do not appear to have much influence on driving. My findings are limited to some extent because they are derived from small sample sizes.Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely on compact development as their only strategy for reducing driving unless their goals for reduced driving are very modest and can be achieved at a low cost.},

	abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

Machine learning offers an alternative data-driven approach for modelling choice behaviour and is increasingly drawing interest in our field. Cross-pollination of machine learning models, techniques and practices could help overcome problems and limitations encountered in the current theory-driven modelling paradigm, such as subjective labour-intensive search pro­ cesses for model selection, and the inability to work with text and image data. However, despite the potential benefits of using the advances of machine learning to improve choice modelling practices, the choice modelling field has been hesitant to embrace machine learning. This dis­ cussion paper aims to consolidate knowledge on the use of machine learning models, techniques and practices for choice modelling, and discuss their potential. Thereby, we hope not only to make the case that further integration of machine learning in choice modelling is beneficial, but also to further facilitate it. To this end, we clarify the similarities and differences between the two modelling paradigms; we review the use of machine learning for choice modelling; and we explore areas of opportunities for embracing machine learning models and techniques to improve our practices. To conclude this discussion paper, we put forward a set of research questions which must be addressed to better understand if and how machine learning can benefit choice modelling.},

We train our ANN to recognise the choice patterns of four distinct decision rules: Random Utility Maximisation, Random Regret Minimisation, Lexicographic, and Random. Next, we apply our trained ANN to classify the respondents from a recent Value-of-Time Stated Choice experiment in terms of their most likely employed decision rule. We cross-validate our findings by comparing our results with those from: (1) single class discrete choice models estimated on subsets of the data, and (2) latent class discrete choice models. The cross-validations provide strong support for the notion that ANNs can be used to identify underlying decision rules in choice data. As such, we believe that ANNs provide a valuable addition to the toolbox of analysts who wish to investigate decision rule heterogeneity. The substantive contribution of this study is that we provide strong empirical evidence for the presence of decision rule heterogeneity amongst travellers.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that personal, neighborhood, and mobility characteristics could influence life satisfaction and loneliness of people and that exposure to public spaces, such as green spaces, may also affect the extent to which people feel lonely or satisfied with life. However, previous studies mainly focused on one of these effects, resulting in a lack of knowledge about the simultaneous effects of these characteristics on loneliness and life satisfaction. This study therefore aims to gain insights into how public-space use mediates the relations between personal, neighborhood, and mobility characteristics on the one hand and loneliness and life satisfaction on the other hand. Relationships were analyzed using a path analysis approach, based on a sample of 200 residents of three neighborhoods of the Dutch city ‘s-Hertogenbosch. The results showed that the influence of frequency of public-space use on life satisfaction and loneliness is limited. The effects of personal, neighborhood, and mobility characteristics on frequency of use of public space and on loneliness and life satisfaction were found to be significant. Age and activities of daily living (ADL) are significantly related to each other, and ADL was found to influence recreational and passive space use and loneliness and life satisfaction. Policymakers should, therefore, mainly focus on creating neighborhoods that are highly walkable and accessible, where green spaces and public-transport facilities are present, to promote physical activity among all residents.},

The second part argues that policy measures are available to improve urban sustainability in transport terms but that the main challenges relate to the necessary conditions for change. These conditions are dependent upon high-quality implementation of innovative schemes, and the need to gain public conﬁdence and acceptability to support these measures through active involvement and action. Seven key elements of sustainable mobility are outlined, so that public acceptability can be more effectively promoted.},

The task is to determine outlines of zones that are reachable from a user’s location in a given amount of time. In this work we focus on travel-time maps with a formally guaranteed SEPARATION PROPERTY in the sense that a zone exactly contains the part of the road network that is reachable within a pre-defined time from a given starting point and start time. In contrast to other automated methods that create travel-time maps, our approach generates schematized travel-time maps that reduce the visual complexity by representing each zone by an octilinear polygon, that is, the edges of the polygons use only eight pre-defined orientations. We aim for octilinear polygons with a small number of bends to further optimize the legibility of the map. The reachable parts of the road network are determined by the integration of timetable information for different modes of public transportation, for example buses, trains or ferries, and pedestrian walkways based on a multimodal time-expanded network. Moreover, the travel-time maps generated visualize multiple travel times using a map overlay of different time zones and taking natural barriers such as rivers into account. In experiments on real-world data we compare our schematic visualizations to travel-time maps created with other visualization techniques with respect to simple but robust quality measures such as the number of bends and the perimeter of the zones.},

Satisfaction with travel has to date been assessed using utility-based models or measures of productivity of the trip. The present study is the ﬁrst to assess the inﬂuence of activities performed during travel on public transport users’ subjective well-being. To this end, a survey was conducted in Sweden in 2010 in which activities during the work commute by public transport were recorded and subjective well-being during travel was measured retrospectively using the Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS). Results show that talking to other passengers has the strongest positive effect on STS, whereas activities related to entertainment and relaxation lead to lower STS, possibly since engaging in these activities reﬂect unsuccessful attempts to abate boredom. In addition, it is found that activities during travel may have a more positive effect on the commute back home, suggesting that the mindset related to the destination inﬂuences travel satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades research on travel mode choice has evolved from work that is informed by utility theory, examining the effects of objective determinants, to studies incorporating more subjective variables such as habits and attitudes. Recently, the way people perceive their travel has been analyzed with transportation-oriented scales of subjective wellbeing, and particularly the satisfaction with travel scale. However, studies analyzing the link between travel mode choice (i.e., decision utility) and travel satisfaction (i.e., experienced utility) are limited. In this paper we will focus on the relation between mode choice and travel satisfaction for leisure trips (with travel-related attitudes and the built environment as explanatory variables) of study participants in urban and suburban neighborhoods in the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is shown that the built environment and travel-related attitudes—both important explanatory variables of travel mode choice—and mode choice itself affect travel satisfaction. Public transit users perceive their travel most negatively, while active travel results in the highest levels of travel satisfaction. Surprisingly, suburban dwellers perceive their travel more positively than urban dwellers, for all travel modes.},

Ten different neighbourhoods have been carefully selected to characterise the two different types of traditional and suburban neighbourhood street layouts. A self-administered questionnaire has been delivered to 2200 households to capture neighbourhood design, travel patterns, travel attitudes and socio-economic characteristics. Multivariate analysis of cross-sectional data shows that some socio-economic variables as well as travel attitudes and neighbourhood design preferences can explain the differences in travel patterns between the two distinct neighbourhood designs. The results show additionally that the traditional neighbourhood group is more sensitive to factors of perception and attitudes in relation to neighbourhood design that lead to walking, cycling and public transport use travel patterns, suggesting that land-use policy designed to accommodate lower carbon-based travel together with measures to encourage active travel will have greater impact on the traditional group than the suburban group. This ﬁnding suggests that generic measures imposed by many governments, and certainly implied by current UK land-use policy, to promote sustainable mobility should be selectively targeted.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the activity-travel behaviour literature that employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques for empirical analysis and modelling. Machine Learning algorithms, which attempt to build intelligence utilizing the availability of large amounts of data, have emerged as powerful tools in the ﬁelds of pattern recognition and big data analysis. These techniques have been applied in activity-travel behaviour studies since the early ’90s when Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) were employed to model mode choice decisions. AMOS, an activity-based modelling system developed in the mid-’90s, has ANN at its core to model and predict individual responses to travel demand management measures. In the dawn of 2000, ALBATROSS, a comprehensive activity-based travel demand modelling system, was proposed by Arentze and Timmermans using Decision Trees. Since then researchers have been exploring ML techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Neural Networks (NN), Bayes Classiﬁers, and more recently, Ensemble Learners to model and predict activity-travel behaviour. A large number of publications over the years and an upward trend in the number of published articles over time indicate that Machine Learning is a promising tool for activity-travel behaviour analysis and prediction. This article, ﬁrst of its kind in the literature, reviews these studies and explores the trends in activity-travel behaviour research that apply ML techniques. The review ﬁnds that mode choice decisions have received wide attention in the literature on ML applications. It was observed that most of the studies identify the lack of interpretability as a serious shortcoming in ML techniques. However, very few studies have attempted to improve the interpretability of the models. Further, some studies report the importance of feature engineering in ML-based studies, but very few studies adopt feature engineering before model development. Spatiotemporal transferability of models is another issue that has received minimal attention in the literature. In the end, the paper discusses possible directions for future research in the area of activity-travel behaviour modelling using ML techniques.},

The desire and intention of using a travel mode – which can be considered as important predictors of mode choice – have, however, received limited attention. Furthermore, existing studies mostly have a narrow scope and lack integration of the above constructs. In this paper, we introduce the travel mode choice cycle (TMCC), a comprehensive model aiming to link attitude, desire, intention, behaviour, and satisfaction by integrating prominent social-psychological attitude theories such as the theory of planned behaviour, the model of goal-directed behaviour, and the theory of cognitive dissonance. We argue that the constructs of the TMCC are strongly interrelated such that they can aﬀect each other in direct and indirect ways. The proposed cycle provides valuable insights for policymakers to stimulate the use of desired travel modes, such as public transport and active travel. We end this paper by providing suggestions for future studies to simultaneously investigate the relationships speciﬁed by the TMCC.},

	abstract = {The sprawling patterns of land development common to metropolitan areas of the US have been blamed for high levels of automobile travel, and thus for air quality problems. In response, smart growth programs—designed to counter sprawl—have gained popularity in the US. Studies show that, all else equal, residents of neighborhoods with higher levels of density, land-use mix, transit accessibility, and pedestrian friendliness drive less than residents of neighborhoods with lower levels of these characteristics. These studies have shed little light, however, on the underlying direction of causality—in particular, whether neighborhood design inﬂuences travel behavior or whether travel preferences inﬂuence the choice of neighborhood. The evidence thus leaves a key question largely unanswered: if cities use land use policies to bring residents closer to destinations and provide viable alternatives to driving, will people drive less and thereby reduce emissions? Here a quasi-longitudinal design is used to investigate the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and travel behavior while taking into account the role of travel preferences and neighborhood preferences in explaining this relationship. A multivariate analysis of crosssectional data shows that diﬀerences in travel behavior between suburban and traditional neighborhoods are largely explained by attitudes. However, a quasi-longitudinal analysis of changes in travel behavior and changes in the built environment shows signiﬁcant associations, even when attitudes have been accounted for, providing support for a causal relationship.},

	abstract = {This work is carried out by Statistics Netherlands in collaboration with the Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis (KiM)/Rijkswaterstaat as an extension to the trend series projects carried out in 2018-2021, in which time series multilevel models have been developed for estimating mobility trends. In the current extension, new data from the Dutch Travel Survey (DTS) over 2021 are added to the series, providing a fourth year of data under the new ODiN design of the DTS. This means there is more data on which estimates of the level break coefficients associated with the latest redesign can be based. However, the mobility in 2020 and 2021 was strongly influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. For that reason, the model also includes Covid effects. The model has been updated to allow for different Covid effects for 2021 compared to 2020. The model has been extended to distinguish five instead of four travel purposes. In particular, trend series for purpose leisure are now estimated separately. At the same time estimation of trends for young children, age class 0 - 5, has been discontinued, as this group is no longer observed under ODiN the design. We describe the updated models for the two target variables considered: the number of trip legs per person per day and the distance travelled per trip leg. A few other small improvements are also addressed, including the incorporation of a bias correction in the input estimates instead of in the back-transformations after model estimation, removing a few small but noisy wiggles in the trend estimates. The models are specified in a hierarchical Bayesian framework and estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method. From the model outputs trend estimates can be computed at various aggregation levels for the mean number of trip legs per person per day and the mean distance traveled per trip leg, as well as for derived quantities such as the mean distance per person per day. Starting from this year, the trend series are benchmarked towards the measurement level of the ODiN design. We motivate this change by means of a revision analysis, and discuss its implications.},

In this paper, however, we will analyze whether the regional land use has an important influence on travel behavior by comparing two regions with a varying land-use pattern: Flanders (Belgium) and the Netherlands. The different land-use pattern seems to have influenced travel behavior in both regions. An active spatial planning policy in the Netherlands, clustering activities in urban surroundings, appears to have realized a sustainable travel behavior, as a substantial share of residents frequently walk, cycle or use public transportation. The rather passive spatial planning in Flanders, resulting in urban sprawl, seems to stimulate car use. The applied mobility policy also has an impact on the travel behavior and land use of the Flemings and the Dutch. Infrastructure is concentrated in Dutch urban environments, whereas Flanders has a more widespread network of infrastructure and cheap public transportation, resulting in a further increase of suburbanization.},

Scenarios and alliance-building with stakeholders supporting sustainable transformation can be helpful for this purpose. Planning research should place stronger emphasis on investigating consequences of European urban and regional development for environmental sustainability and social justice not only locally but also at a wider geographical scale including the Global South. There is a need for strengthened regional planning across local administrative boundaries in urban regions, and for binding regulations promoting sustainability at a national, European, and global scale.

Several attempts have been made in order to identify the true effects of built environment characteristics by controlling for attitudinal and lifestyle factors and by applying more sophisticated techniques of analysis. Most research still suffers from insufﬁcient theorizing and empirical investigation of causal mechanisms. An implicit conception of causality in terms of correlation between subsequent events appears to be widespread. This paper argues that such a conception of causality is inadequate and can lead to model speciﬁcation error. Instead, a conception of causality as tendencies engendered by generative mechanisms is proposed. Based on such an understanding, the paper discusses in what sense the built environment can be said to exert causal inﬂuences on travel behaviour. In order to integrate knowledge about causal inﬂuences at the level of the individual and at the city level, a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods is recommended.},

	abstract = {Road network congestion; a traffic state characterised by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queuing; is a major issue in most urban areas around the globe. Building more roads is a commonly employed policy intervention to reduce congestion. This strategy, however, is controversial because under certain conditions road capacity expansions may induce growth in traffic volumes. A crucial precursor to understanding whether road capacity expansions provide a solution to congestion is to quantify the technology driving congestion in urban road networks. This congestion technology describes the variation in performance of the network, often represented by traffic flow through the road network, over its intensity of use given by the number of vehicles in the network. However, obtaining empirical estimates of congestion technology from data on traffic variables is challenging due to statistical biases that emerge via the complex interactions between traffic flow, traffic controls, and capacity. To adjust for such biases, this paper presents an approach based on causal statistical modelling to quantify the nature and form of congestion technology in road networks in twenty-four cities worldwide. Our results suggest that increasing network capacity is in general not an efficient solution to manage congestion, in the sense that the average travel speed in the network does not increase substantially with an increase in capacity. This result and our congestion technology estimates have important implications for optimal urban transportation strategies.},

This paper proposes a novel method, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs), to predict the nonlinear and imbalanced incident clearance time based on different types of explanatory variables. The GBDT inherits both the advantages of statistical models and AI approaches, and can identify the complex and nonlinear relationship while computing the relative importance among variables. One-year crash data from Washington state, USA, incident tracking system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of GBDT method. Based on the distribution of incident clearance time, two groups are categorized for prediction with a 15-min threshold. A comparative study confirms that the GBDT method is significantly superior to other algorithms for incidents with both short and long clearance times. In addition, incident response time is found to be the greatest contributor to short clearance time with more than 41\% relative importance, while traffic volume generates the second greatest impact on incident clearance time with relative importance of 27.34\% and 19.56\%, respectively.},

We examine this presumption by finding the commuting pattern for the Los Angeles region in 1980 which would minimise average commuting time or distance, given the actual spatial distributions of job and housing locations. We find that the amount of commuting required by these distributions is far less than actual commuting, and that variations in required commuting across job locations only weakly explain variations in actual commuting. We conclude that other factors must be more important to location decisions than commuting cost, and that policies aimed at changing the jobs-housing balance will have only a minor effect on commuting.},

Nevertheless, individuals’ travel time expenditures do show patterns that can be partly explained by measurable characteristics. Travel time expenditure is strongly related to individual and household characteristics (e.g., income level, gender, employment status, and car ownership), attributes of activities at the destination (e.g., activity group and activity duration), and characteristics of residential areas (e.g., density, spatial structure, and level of service). To the extent that travel time expenditures are constant at the aggregate level, the underlying mechanisms explaining that regularity are not well understood. Consequently, further research into explaining travel time and money expenditure patterns is justified.},

	abstract = {Research on car dependence exposes the difficulty of moving away from a car-dominated, high-carbon transport system, but neglects the political-economic factors underpinning car-dependent societies. Yet these factors are key constraints to attempts to ‘decouple' human well-being from energy use and climate change emissions. In this critical review paper, we identify some of the main political-economic factors behind car dependence, drawing together research from several fields. Five key constituent elements of what we call the ‘car-dependent transport system’ are identified: i) the automotive industry; ii) the provision of car infrastructure; iii) the political economy of urban sprawl; iv) the provision of public transport; v) cultures of car consumption. Using the ‘systems of provision’ approach within political economy, we locate the part played by each element within the key dynamic processes of the system as a whole. Such processes encompass industrial structure, political-economic relations, the built environment, and cultural feedback loops. We argue that linkages between these processes are crucial to maintaining car dependence and thus create carbon lock-in. In developing our argument we discuss several important characteristics of car-dependent transport systems: the role of integrated sociotechnical aspects of provision, the opportunistic use of contradictory economic arguments serving industrial agendas, the creation of an apolitical façade around pro-car decision-making, and the ‘capture’ of the state within the car-dependent transport system. Through uncovering the constituents, processes and characteristics of car-dependent transport systems, we show that moving past the automobile age will require an overt and historically aware political program of research and action.},

	abstract = {Although mixed use is an emerging strategy that has been widely accepted in urban planning for promoting neighbourhood vibrancy, there is no consensus on how to quantitatively measure the mix and the effects of mixed use on neighbourhood vibrancy. Shannon entropy, the most commonly used diversity measurement in assessing mixed use, has been found to be inadequate in measuring the multifaceted, multidimensional characteristics of mixed use. And lack of data also makes it difficult to find the relationship between mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy. However, the recent availability of new sources including mobile phone data and Point of Interest (POI) data have made it possible to develop new indices of mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy to analyse their relationships. Taking advantage of these emerging new data sources, this study used the numbers of mobile phone users in a 24-hour period as a proxy of neighbourhood vibrancy and used POIs from a navigation database to develop a series of mixed-use indicators that can better reflect the multifaceted, multidimensional characteristics of mixed-use neighbourhoods. The Hill numbers, a unified form of diversity measurement used in ecological literature that includes richness, entropy, and the Simpson index, are used to measure the degrees of mixed use. Using such fine-grained data sets and the Hill numbers allowed us to obtain better insights into the relationship between mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy. Four models varying in POI measurements that reflect different dimensions of mixed use were presented. The results showed that either POI density or entropy can explain approximately 1\% of neighbourhood vibrancy, while POI richness contributes significantly in improving neighbourhood vibrancy. The results also revealed that the entropy has limitations as a measure for representing mixed use and demonstrated the necessity of adopting a set of more appropriate measurements for mixed use. Increasing the number of POIs has limited power to improve neighbourhood vibrancy compared with encouraging the mixing of complementary POIs. These exploratory findings may be useful for adjusting mixed-use assessments and to help guide urban planning and neighbourhood design.},

We find that when analyzing two dimensions of land use, generally both the Balance Index and the Dissimilarity Index should be used, and that the Dissimilarity Index should be tested at multiple scales. We provide a number of other practical recommendations about which mixed use measure to apply given the contextual information available to a researcher or analyst.},

The key to their success has been a coordinated package of mutually reinforcing transport and landuse policies that have made car use slower, less convenient, and more costly, while increasing the safety, convenience, and feasibility of walking, cycling, and public transport. The mix of policies implemented in each city has been somewhat different. The German cities have done far more to promote cycling, while Zurich and Vienna offer more public transport service per capita at lower fares. All ﬁve of the cities have implemented roughly the same policies to promote walking, foster compact mixed-use development, and discourage car use. Of the car-restrictive policies, parking management has been by far the most important. The ﬁve case study cities demonstrate that it is possible to reduce car dependence even in afﬂuent societies with high levels of car ownership and high expectations for quality of travel.},

These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network.

As such, there is a need to determine the factors influencing the walking behavior of older people in the era of population aging. Streetscape greenery is an easily perceived built-environment attribute and can promote walking behavior, but it has received insufficient attention. More importantly, the non-linear effects of streetscape greenery on the walking behavior of older adults have not been examined. We therefore use readily available Google Street View imagery and a fully convolutional neural network to evaluate human-scale, eye-level streetscape greenery. Using data from the Hong Kong Travel Characteristic Survey, we adopt a machine learning technique, namely random forest modeling, to scrutinize the non-linear effects of streetscape greenery on the walking propensity of older adults. The results show that streetscape greenery has a positive effect on walking propensity within a certain range, but outside the range, the positive association no longer holds. The non-linear associations of other built-environment attributes are also examined.},

In the present study, we statistically explore the relationship between cycling levels, urban form and sociodemographic variables in Amsterdam at a postcode level of detail. Overall, our findings suggest that in a mature cycling city like Amsterdam, there exists a clear relationship between urban form and cycling rates, and that this relationship is probably stronger than in less mature cycling contexts. While cycling is significantly correlated with a variety of land use and destination accessibility variables, the most important underlying relationship appears to be between address density and cycling; after accounting for address density, other urban form variables are not significant predictors of cycling levels. However, we also found that the relation between cycling and address density becomes insignificant once we take the ethnicity and educational level of postcode residents into account. Given the strong positive association between address density and the educational level of postcode residents, it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of these two variables on local cycling rates.},

The results showed that the large-sized, high-density, unequally distributed and dispersed pattern is a relevant strategy for both groups to minimize vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) per capita. For group 1, increasing the average travel distance may be an efficient strategy to reduce the number of automobile trips. For group 2, however, decreasing the average travel distance may be a more efficient strategy. Previous recommendations for a so-called compact urban form require more validation before adoption in Korea. Different strategies are required for areas that show different characteristics in order to reduce VKT.

The first step was designing a conceptual framework based on literature on sustainable development and transport while incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of relevance for urban transport planning. The second step was to identify and select indicators for the index using literature, indicator criteria, and input from an expert group meeting. This led to a consolidated list of ten indicators. The final step was to construct the index itself. This involved decisions on ways to normalize, weigh and calculate the elements of the index. The resulting Second regional expert meeting expert endorsed the refined index with ten indicators and agreed for pilot application of SUTI in selected Asian cities. It is also recognized that additional work on data collection and analysis will be required to apply SUTI and regularly report and compare the performance of urban transport systems in cities in practice. The application of SUTI in four pilot cities is ongoing with preliminary results used for illustration. It is hoped that SUTI would be a useful tool to evaluate and assess the state of urban transportation systems in Asian cities. The analysis of urban transport systems would provide useful insights into policy suggestions and actions required for improving urban transport system and services. The SUTI would help measure progress in improving urban transport and contribute to the achievement of SDG target 11.2 on improving public transport in urban areas.},

Taken to the extreme, these ideas promise a future ‘Velotopia’ in which cycling constitutes a dominant or single mobility mode. Focusing its attention on Dutch cycling innovations and two recently envisaged cycling utopias by Steven Fleming and Cosmin Popan, the present paper offers a critical exploration of current velotopian urban imaginaries. It does so by tracing their ideological ancestry back to two visionary urban designs of the 20th century: the dense city of speed and efficiency of Le Corbusier, and the endless Babylon of Constant where mobility is a means of discovery, play and human interaction. Our analysis shows that both Corbusian and Constantian understandings of mobility are reflected in current velotopian imaginaries, not only in opposition but also in combination with each other. This combination of Corbusian and Constantian velotopian imaginaries, we suggest, has largely become part of mainstream urban discourses instead of providing a radical alternative to them.},

These technologies are gathered together under the marketing term 'serverless' and the providers suggest that they have the potential to significantly change how client/server applications are designed, developed and operated. This paper presents two case industrial studies of early adopters, showing how migrating an application to the Lambda deployment architecture reduced hosting costs-by between 66\% and 95\%-and discusses how further adoption of this trend might influence common software architecture design practices.

This plan involves several decisions, and they need not be taken in the order in which they make sense to us and the order of their presentation here. The overall decision involves which approach should be used to study a topic. Informing this decision should be the philosophical assumptions the researcher brings to the study; procedures of inquiry (called research designs); and specific research methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The selection of a research approach is also based on the nature of the research problem or issue being addressed, the researchers' personal experiences, and the audiences for the study. Thus, in this book, research approaches, research designs, and research methods are three key terms that represent a perspective about research that presents information in a successive way from broad constructions of research to the narrow procedures of methods. In this book, three research approaches are advanced: (a) qualitative, (b) quantitative, and (c) mixed methods. Unquestionably, the three approaches are not as discrete as they first appear. Qualitative and quantitative approaches should not be viewed as rigid, distinct categories, polar opposites, or dichotomies. Instead, they represent different ends on a continuum (Creswell, 2015; Newman \& Benz, 1998). A study tends to be more qualitative than quantitative or vice versa. Mixed methods research resides in the middle of this continuum because it incorporates elements of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Often the distinction between qualitative research and quantitative research is framed in terms of using words (qualitative) rather than numbers (quantitative), or better yet, using closed-ended questions and responses (quantitative hypotheses) or open-ended questions and responses (qualita-tive interview questions). A more complete way to view the gradations of differences between them is in the basic philosophical assumptions researchers bring to the study, the types of research strategies used in the research (e.g., quantitative experiments or qualitative case studies), and the specific methods employed in conducting these strategies (e.g., collecting data quantitatively on instruments versus collecting qualitative data through observing a setting). Moreover, there is a historical evolution to both approaches-with},

Objective: We describe whether the health benefits from the increased physical activity of a modal shift for urban commutes outweigh the health risks. Data sources and extraction: We have summarized the literature for air pollution, traffic accidents, and physical activity using systematic reviews supplemented with recent key studies. Data synthesis: We quantified the impact on all-cause mortality when 500,000 people would make a transition from car to bicycle for short trips on a daily basis in the Netherlands. We have expressed mortality impacts in life-years gained or lost, using life table calculations. For individuals who shift from car to bicycle, we estimated that beneficial effects of increased physical activity are substantially larger (3-14 months gained) than the potential mortality effect of increased inhaled air pollution doses (0.8-40 days lost) and the increase in traffic accidents (5-9 days lost). Societal benefits are even larger because of a modest reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and traffic accidents. Conclusions: On average, the estimated health benefits of cycling were substantially larger than the risks relative to car driving for individuals shifting their mode of transport.},

Methods: National surveys of travel behavior and health indicators in Europe, North America, and Australia were used in this study; the surveys were conducted in 1994 to 2006. In some cases raw data were obtained from national or federal agencies and then analyzed, and in other cases summary data were obtained from, published reports. Results: Countries with the highest levels of active transportation generally had the lowest obesity rates. Europeans walked more than United States residents (382 versus 140 km per person per year) and bicycled more (188 versus 40 km per person per year) in 2000. Discussion: Walking and bicycling are far more common in European countries than in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Active transportation is inversely related to obesity in these countries. Although the results do not prove causality, they suggest that active transportation could be one of the factors that explain international differences in obesity rates. © 2008 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

The developed controller makes a realtime decisions about whether to increase or decrease (and how much) the current green time in order to get out the over-saturation situation. First, a discrete-time model that describes the evolution of the queue lengths at signalized intersection is presented. Then, the control problem is formulated and solved by using the dissipative system theory. Moreover, the proposed intersection controller needs to be provided with a real-time input traffic flow data. To achieve this goal, we use the artificial neural networks technique as input traffic flow data predictor. The results of the simulations indicate that our control strategy guarantees a high degree of control benefit. © 2011 IFAC.},

	abstract = {In many European cities, support for public transport and cycling in daily mobility is considered an efficient means to reduce air pollution, traffic jams, and carbon emissions. Shared bicycle systems have turned out effective in increasing cycling in many urban areas, particularly when combined with public transportation. In this study, we make an effort to model a hypothetical shared bike system and quantify its spatial effect on public transport travel times. The study area is one of the fastest growing urban agglomerations in Europe, the Greater Helsinki area in Finland. We model the travel times between the population and 16 important destinations in the city centre of Helsinki by public transportation and by public transportation extended with shared bikes. We use open route and timetable databases and tools developed in-house to perform extensive data mining through application programming interfaces (APIs). We show 1) that open transport information interfaces can provide a new effective means to evaluate multimodal accessibility patterns in urban areas and 2) that the launch of a bicycle sharing system could reduce public transportation travel times in the study area on average by more than 10\%, meaning some 6min per each individual trip. We conclude that bicycle sharing systems complementing the traditional public transport system could potentially increase the competitiveness and attractiveness of sustainable modes of urban transport and thus help cities to promote sustainable daily mobility. Finally, we emphasize that the availability of open data sources on urban transport information - such as the public transport data in our case - is vital for analysis of multimodal urban mobility patterns. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Car-dependent city planning has resulted in high levels of environmental pollution, sedentary lifestyles and increased vulnerability to the effects of climate change. The Barcelona Superblock model is an innovative urban and transport planning strategy that aims to reclaim public space for people, reduce motorized transport, promote sustainable mobility and active lifestyles, provide urban greening and mitigate effects of climate change. We estimated the health impacts of implementing this urban model across Barcelona. Methods: We carried out a quantitative health impact assessment (HIA) study for Barcelona residents ≥20 years (N = 1,301,827) on the projected Superblock area level (N = 503), following the comparative risk assessment methodology. We 1) estimated expected changes in (a) transport-related physical activity (PA), (b) air pollution (NO2), (c) road traffic noise, (d) green space, and (e) reduction of the urban heat island (UHI) effect through heat reductions; 2) scaled available risk estimates; and 3) calculated attributable health impact fractions. Estimated endpoints were preventable premature mortality, changes in life expectancy and economic impacts. Results: We estimated that 667 premature deaths (95\% CI: 235–1,098) could be prevented annually through implementing the 503 Superblocks. The greatest number of preventable deaths could be attributed to reductions in NO2 (291, 95\% PI: 0–838), followed by noise (163, 95\% CI: 83–246), heat (117, 95\% CI: 101–137), and green space development (60, 95\% CI: 0–119). Increased PA for an estimated 65,000 persons shifting car/motorcycle trips to public and active transport resulted in 36 preventable deaths (95\% CI: 26–50). The Superblocks were estimated to result in an average increase in life expectancy for the Barcelona adult population of almost 200 days (95\% CI: 99–297), and result in an annual economic impact of 1.7 billion EUR (95\% CI: 0.6–2.8). Discussion: The Barcelona Superblocks were estimated to help reduce harmful environmental exposures (i.e. air pollution, noise, and heat) while simultaneously increase PA levels and access to green space, and thereby provide substantial health benefits. For an equitable distribution of health benefits, the Superblocks should be implemented consistently across the entire city. Similar health benefits are expected for other cities that face similar challenges of environmental pollution, climate change vulnerability and low PA levels, by adopting the Barcelona Superblock model.},

	abstract = {Analysing the accessibility disparity between different travel modes is recognised as an efficient way to assess the environmental and social sustainability of transport and land use arrangements. Travel times by different travel modes form an essential part of such an analysis. This paper aims to assess the comparability of different methods for calculating travel time by different travel modes. First, we briefly review the methods used in previous studies and identify different typical approaches, which we then compare. We use three computational models respectively for car and public transport (PT), implemented in our case study area, the capital region of Finland. In the car models, (1) the simple model ignores congestion and parking in travel time calculation; (2) the intermediate car model accounts for congestion but ignores parking; and (3) the more advanced car model takes into account all parts of the journey, including congestion and parking. For PT, (1) the simple model accounts for transit routes but ignores schedules; (2) the intermediate model incorporates schedule data in a simplistic way; and (3) the more advanced model adopts a door-to-door approach where true schedules (incl. congestion) and realistic route combinations are accounted for. Our results show that absolute differences in car and PT travel times are notable in the Greater Helsinki area, no matter which models are used for comparison. Modal travel time disparity appears smallest in the city centre area. We conclude that using conceptually corresponding models for car and PT travel time calculations is the key to achieving a reliable analysis of modal accessibility disparity. A door-to-door approach in travel time calculations (adopted in the most advanced models) also makes the results truly comparable in absolute terms. Finally, the more advanced the applied methods are, the more data hungry the analysis is. Here, recent developments in open data policies among urban transport data producers become very helpful. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Using a health impact assessment framework, we estimated the population health effects arising from alternative land-use and transport policy initiatives in six cities. Land-use changes were modelled to reflect a compact city in which land-use density and diversity were increased and distances to public transport were reduced to produce low motorised mobility, namely a modal shift from private motor vehicles to walking, cycling, and public transport. The modelled compact city scenario resulted in health gains for all cities (for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease) with overall health gains of 420–826 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 000 population. However, for moderate to highly motorised cities, such as Melbourne, London, and Boston, the compact city scenario predicted a small increase in road trauma for cyclists and pedestrians (health loss of between 34 and 41 DALYs per 100 000 population). The findings suggest that government policies need to actively pursue land-use elements—particularly a focus towards compact cities—that support a modal shift away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and low-emission public transport. At the same time, these policies need to ensure the provision of safe walking and cycling infrastructure. The findings highlight the opportunities for policy makers to positively influence the overall health of city populations.},

The taxi trips with origins and destinations in proximity to BSS stations are identified and compared to BSS trips from the same origin and destinations. The travel time comparison is conducted along following dimensions: (a) all trips, (b) temporal dimension including different time periods of the day, weekday versus weekend, and seasonal variation, and (c) distance categories. It is found that during weekdays’ AM, Midday and PM time periods for more than half of OD pairs with distance less than 3 km, BSS is either faster or competitive with taxi mode. To further shed light on the travel time comparison, we develop a multivariate analysis using a random utility framework in the form of a panel mixed multinomial logit model. Identifying and understanding the factors that influence the travel time differences can help planners to enhance the BSS service offerings. The provision of information to bicycling-inclined individuals on the “faster” alternative could be used as a marketing tool to attract higher usage for BSS within dense urban cores. The comparison of BSS and taxi can also shed light on the competition between bicycle and car modes in general in dense urban areas.},

Researchers and advocates are increasingly focused on how traffic crashes are reported in the media, and whether existing editorial patterns contribute to victim-blaming and distract from systems-level solutions. However, no previous study has examined whether editorial patterns in traffic crash coverage actually influence perceptions. This study conducted an experiment in which 999 subjects were randomly assigned to read one of three versions of a news article describing a traffic crash involving a pedestrian. After reading the description, subjects were asked to apportion blame, identify an appropriate punishment for the driver, and assess various approaches for improving road safety. In comparing the three groups, even relatively subtle differences in editorial patterns significantly affected readers' interpretation of both what happened and what to do about it on nearly every measure. Shifting from pedestrian-focused to driver-focused language reduced victim-blaming and increased perceived blame for the driver. A thematic frame significantly increased support for infrastructure improvements. This study provides strong evidence that efforts to change public perceptions of road safety should include a focus on improving editorial patterns in traffic crash reporting.},

	abstract = {While quantitative methods have been widely applied by social scientists such as sociologists, psychologists, and economists, their philosophical premises and assumptions are rarely examined. The philosophical ideas introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) are helpful for researchers in understanding the application of quantitative methods specific to the foundational concepts of deduction, abduction and induction. In the Peircean logical system the nature of knowledge and reality relate to each of these concepts: the logic of abduction and deduction contribute to our conceptual understanding of a phenomenon, while the logic of induction adds quantitative details to our conceptual knowledge. At the stage of abduction, the goal is to explore data, find a pattern, and suggest a plausible hypothesis; deduction is to refine the hypothesis based upon other plausible premises; and induction is empirical substantiation. This article seeks to investigate the premises, limitations and applications of deduction, abduction and induction within quantitative methodology.},

RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current computing frameworks handle inefficiently: iterative algorithms and interactive data mining tools. In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude. To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture. We have implemented RDDs in a system called Spark, which we evaluate through a variety of user applications and benchmarks.},

	issn = {1476072X},
	doi = {10.1186/s12942-017-0105-9},
	abstract = {Background: The potential spatial access to urban health services is an important issue in health geography, spatial epidemiology and public health. Computing geographical accessibility measures for residential areas (e.g. census tracts) depends on a type of distance, a method of aggregation, and a measure of accessibility. The aim of this paper is to compare discrepancies in results for the geographical accessibility of health services computed using six distance types (Euclidean and Manhattan distances; shortest network time on foot, by bicycle, by public transit, and by car), four aggregation methods, and fourteen accessibility measures. Methods: To explore variations in results according to the six types of distance and the aggregation methods, correlation analyses are performed. To measure how the assessment of potential spatial access varies according to three parameters (type of distance, aggregation method, and accessibility measure), sensitivity analysis (SA) and uncertainty analysis (UA) are conducted. Results: First, independently of the type of distance used except for shortest network time by public transit, the results are globally similar (correlation {\textgreater}0.90). However, important local variations in correlation between Cartesian and the four shortest network time distances are observed, notably in suburban areas where Cartesian distances are less precise. Second, the choice of the aggregation method is also important: compared with the most accurate aggregation method, accessibility measures computed from census tract centroids, though not inaccurate, yield important measurement errors for 10\% of census tracts. Third, the SA results show that the evaluation of potential geographic access may vary a great deal depending on the accessibility measure and, to a lesser degree, the type of distance and aggregation method. Fourth, the UA results clearly indicate areas of strong uncertainty in suburban areas, whereas central neighbourhoods show lower levels of uncertainty. Conclusion: In order to accurately assess potential geographic access to health services in urban areas, it is particularly important to choose a precise type of distance and aggregation method. Then, depending on the research objectives, the choices of the type of network distance (according to the mode of transportation) and of a number of accessibility measures should be carefully considered and adequately justified.},

This qualitative study explored images and perceptions of cycling, their potential influence on cycling and whether these views differed between regular, occasional and non-riders.Seventy participants (24 males and 46 females) were recruited. Of these, 22 were classified as non-riders, 23 were occasional riders and 25 were regular riders. Twelve focus groups were held in inner Sydney during October and November 2005. Data were audio taped, transcribed and thematically analysed.Themes linked to images of cycling included: 'clean and green'; 'healthy and fun'; 'dangerous' and 'serious business'. Themes linked to images of cyclists included: 'risk takers and law breakers' and 'status and sub-cultures'. Discussion centred on the low social status of riding over other transport modes, the relative acceptability of different riding sub-cultures, the 'green' image of cycling transport and the status associated with the riders clothing and bicycle choice, especially lycra and its 'serious and sporty' connotation.While 'cycling' was generally viewed as a positive, environmentally friendly activity, the actions of some 'cyclists' were disliked, which influenced views about cycling, particularly among non-riders. A cycling acceptability hierarchy emerged; with recreational riding at the top, followed by cycling for sport and exercise, with transport/commuter cycling towards the bottom. Bicycle couriers were viewed least favourably. A common perception among non-riders was the latter two groups were rule breakers and risk takers, while regular riders felt unfairly judged by this stereotype.While there was greater acceptance of recreational riding, riding for transport was not viewed as a mainstream activity. There is a need to improve the public acceptability of cycling and change public norms so it is seen as an everyday activity that can be undertaken by almost anyone, without the need for special clothing, expensive equipment or limited to purpose built facilities. © 2010.},

	abstract = {In this paper we focus on the development of a new service model for accessing transport, namely Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and present one of the first critical analyses of the rhetoric surrounding the concept. One central assumption of one prevalent MaaS conceptualization is that transport services are bundled into service packages for monthly payment, as in the telecommunication or media service sectors. Various other forms of MaaS are being developed but all tend to offer door-to-door multi-modal mobility services, brokered via digital platforms connecting users and service operators. By drawing on literature concerned with socio-technical transitions, we address two multi-layered questions. First, to what extent can the MaaS promises (to citizens and cities) be delivered, and what are the unanticipated societal implications that could arise from a wholesale adoption of MaaS in relation to key issues such as wellbeing, emissions and social inclusion? Second, what are de facto challenges for urban governance if the packaged services model of MaaS is widely adopted, and what are the recommended responses? To address these questions, we begin by considering the evolution of intelligent transport systems that underpin the current vision of MaaS and highlight how the new business model could provide a mechanism to make MaaS truly disruptive. We then identify a set of plausible unanticipated societal effects that have implications for urban planning and transport governance. This is followed by a critical assessment of the persuasive rhetoric around MaaS that makes grand promises about efficiency, choice and freedom. Our conclusion is that the range of possible unanticipated consequences carries risks that require public intervention (i.e. steering) for reasons of both efficiency and equity.},

Transport sustainability index has been computed as (5.05, 6.62, 8.12) and weaker transport sustainability attributes were found. Transport sustainability index highlights the question how far toward becoming transport sustainable is an enterprise or region? While, weaker transport sustainability attributes reveals that how can an enterprise or region improve its transport sustainability effectively? Appropriate actions were initiated to improve urban transport sustainability performance. The results indicate that the model is capable of effectively assessing transport sustainability and has practical relevance. An example is also used to illustrate the approach developed.

	abstract = {The paper focuses on the use and influence of indicators in European sustainable transport policy from a 'knowledge utilization' research point of view. The starting point is the contrast between the widely held idea that indicators are important tools for sustainable transport policy making, versus 'knowledge utilization' oriented research, which has often demonstrated that formal technical knowledge is used much less, or at least differently, than expected in policy and decision making. The paper looks at two cases of indicators applied for strategic policy making within the sustainable transport agenda. The first case concerns indicators tracking the fulfillment of national transport policy objectives in Sweden. The case explores the use and influence of an annual monitoring and evaluation report produced for this purpose, within a general 'Management-by-Objectives' regime. The second case deals with indicators applied for the Mid-Term Review of the European Commission's transport policy White Paper 'Time to Decide' (issued in 2001). The focus in this case is on a particular indicator based study conducted in 2005 by a group of consultants in close collaboration with European Commission staff. It is found that several indicators in both cases are actually used in policy processes, with evidence of use found in documents as well as interviews. However, 'use' does not automatically mean 'influence' on policies or processes in more than a superficial manner. Indicators seem to play a very limited direct instrumental role, while some signs of symbolic, conceptual and process roles are found. In the EU case we identify what is called a rationalization role of indicators, meaning that indicators inform and help to rationalize a change in the position towards key objectives. Several factors that characterize the indicators, the users, and policy context are found to contribute to understand the type of use and influence observed in both cases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking a wide perspective on contemporary debates, this paper addresses the general retreat from utopian urbanism in recent years. It connects it with the so-called crisis of modernist urbanism in the capitalist West as well as forms of 'utopie degeneration', and assesses some of its implications. Arguing against the abandonment of utopian perspectives, it advocates a rethinking of utopianism through considering its potential function in developing critical approaches to urban questions. The authoritarianism of much utopian urbanism certainly needs acknowledging and criticising, but this need not entail a retreat from imagining alternatives and dreaming of better worlds. Instead, it is necessary to reconceptualise Utopia, and to open up the field of utopian urbanism that for too long has been understood in an overly narrow way. The paper suggests the potential value of developing, in particular, modes of critical and transformative utopianism that are open, dynamic and that, far from being compensatory, aim to estrange the taken-for-granted, to interrupt space and time, and to open up perspectives on what might be.},

To start with, transition management understands the relation transition initiatives adopt towards existing regimes not in political, but in market terms. This impacts their internal processes, which are based on a deliberative notion of democracy, assuming the existence of a common good and misrecognizing the constitutive role of conflict. Moreover, transition management embraces a governance approach centring on public–private bodies which, in the name of bottom-up processes and participation, especially gives a voice to a privileged group of business, policy and civil society actors. Insofar as citizens get a place, it is merely in their role as consumers. Finally, as it is based on a market model itself, transition management fails to politicize one of the most fundamental current ‘landscape’ elements. The crucial question is how these features affect transition management’s possibilities to contribute to effective and democratic sustainable change.},

This paper identifies issues related to the definition, evaluation and implementation of sustainable transportation. Significant issues include the range of definitions of sustainability, the range of issues considered under sustainability, the range of perspectives, criticism of sustainability analysis, evaluating sustainability, transportation impacts on sustainability, goals vs. objectives, sustainable transport decision making, approaches to sustainable transport, automobile dependency, equity, land use, community liveability, and sustainable transportation solutions. Sustainable development originally focused on a few resource consumption issues, but it is increasingly defined more broadly to include economic and social welfare, equity, human health and ecological integrity. A narrow definition of sustainable transport tends to favour individual technological solutions, while a broader definition tends to favour more integrated solutions, including improved travel choices, economic incentives, institutional reforms, land use changes as well as technological innovation. Sustainability planning may require changing the way people think about and solve transportation problems. Copyright © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview on what has been achieved and also think ahead on what can be achieved in the future. It is our opinion that using high-resolution event data, instead of conventional aggregate data, could bring significant improvements to current research and practices in traffic engineering. Event data records the times when a vehicle arrives at and departs from a vehicle detector. From that, individual vehicle's on-detector-time and time gap between two consecutive vehicles can be derived. Such detailed information is of great importance for traffic modeling and control. As reviewed in this paper, current research has demonstrated that event data are extremely helpful in the fields of detector error diagnosis, vehicle classification, freeway travel time estimation, arterial performance measure, signal control optimization, traffic safety, traffic flow theory, and environmental studies. In addition, the cost of event data collection is low compared to other data collection techniques since event data can be directly collected from existing controller cabinet without any changes on the infrastructure, and can be continuously collected in 24/7 mode. This brings many research opportunities as suggested in the paper. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Further analysis was conducted on the eye movement parameters of the three areas.

As the driving speed and information quantity increased, the fixation number and duration in traffic sign area have an increasing trend and drivers have less visual cognition to front lane. When the guide signs have more than five amount of information, drivers' fixation number and duration have an abrupt change and the effectiveness of visual cognition decreased significantly.

	abstract = {Background: More evidence is needed on the impacts of building infrastructure for walking and cycling. A knowledge gap and an implementation gap have been mutually reinforcing. This paper reports on a longitudinal study examining the impacts of the still in progress ‘mini-Hollands programme’, which seeks to transform local environments for walking and cycling, in three Outer London boroughs. Compared to Inner London, Outer London has low levels of cycling and low levels of walking, and is relatively car dependent. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study of 1712 individuals sampled from households in mini-Holland boroughs (intervention sample) and from non mini-Holland Outer London boroughs (control sample). The intervention sample was further divided, a priori, into those living in “high-dose neighbourhoods”, where substantial changes to the local walking and cycling infrastructure had been implemented, versus “low-dose neighbourhoods” where such improvements had not (yet) been made. At both baseline (2016) and one-year follow-up (2017), we administered an online survey of travel behaviour and attitudes to transport and the local environment. Results: One year's worth of interventions was associated with an increase in active travel among those living in areas defined as ‘high-dose’ neighbourhoods. Specifically, those in high-dose areas were 24\% more likely to have done any past-week cycling at follow-up, compared to those living in non mini-Holland areas (95\% CI, 2\% to 52\%). The mid-point estimate for increase in active travel (walking plus cycling) time for the same group was an additional 41.0 min (95\% CI 7.0, 75.0 min). Positive changes in views about local environments were recorded in intervention areas, driven by a perceived improvement in cycling-related items. Controversy related to the interventions is expressed in a growth in perceptions that ‘too much’ money is spent on cycling in intervention areas. However, intervention areas also saw a reduction in perceptions that ‘too little’ money is spent (the latter view being common both at baseline and Wave 1 in control areas). Conclusion: Overall, the findings here suggest that programme interventions, while controversial, are having a measurable and early impact on active travel behaviour and perceptions of the local cycling environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Transport mode choice has been associated with different health risks and benefits depending on which transport mode is used. We aimed to evaluate the association between different transport modes use and several health and social contact measures. 

METHODS
We based our analyses on the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA) longitudinal study, conducted over a period of two years in seven European cities. 8802 participants finished the baseline questionnaire, and 3567 answered the final questionnaire. Participants were 18 years of age or older (16 years of age or older in Zurich) and lived, worked and/or studied in one of the case-study cities. Associations between transport mode use and health/social contact measures were estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression models, linear regression models, and logistic regression models according to the data available. All the associations were assessed with single and multiple transport mode models. All models were adjusted for potential confounders. 

RESULTS
In multiple transport mode models, bicycle use was associated with good self-perceived health [OR (CI 95\%) = 1.07 (1.05, 1.08)], all the mental health measures [perceived stress: coef (CI 95\%) = −0.016 (−0.028, −0.004); mental health: coef (CI 95\%) = 0.11 (0.05, 0.18); vitality: coef (CI 95\%) = 0.14 (0.07, 0.22)], and with fewer feelings of loneliness [coef (CI 95\%) = −0.03 (−0.05, −0.01)]. Walking was associated with good self-perceived health [OR (CI 95\%) = 1.02 (1.00, 1.03)], higher vitality [coef (CI 95\%) = 0.14 (0.05, 0.23)], and more frequent contact with friends/family [OR (CI 95\%) = 1.03 (1.00, 1.05)]. Car use was associated with fewer feelings of loneliness [coef (CI 95\%) = −0.04 (−0.06, −0.02)]. The results for e-bike and public transport use were non-significant, and the results for motorbike use were inconclusive. 

CONCLUSIONS
Similarity of findings across cities suggested that active transport, especially bicycle use, should be encouraged to improve population health and social outcomes.},

	abstract = {The information that a driver uses is predominantly visual, and wide ranges of specific driving behaviors, from navigation to anticipation of hazardous events, are primarily dependent on the optimum deployment of attention through overt eye movements. Essentially, eye movements consist of two primary events: fixations and saccades. Fixations are periods of relative stability, during which the eyes focus on something in the visual scene. Saccades are rapid, ballistic jumps of the eye that separate the fixations and serve to orient the focus of the eyes from one point of interest to another. The simplest conception of whether an individual has looked at a certain object in a scene is whether the eye coordinates recorded by an eye tracker are coincident with the world coordinates of the object. This can be calculated automatically for eye movements to static images, where the precise coordinates of an object are easily defined and related to the eye position coordinates. Many eye tracking software packages allow areas of interest (AOIs) to be generated for particular pictures, which allow automatic calculation of when individuals look at specific objects. These AOIs are regions of a visual image that are defined by two-dimensional (2D) coordinates in the viewing plane and thus allow the software to identify fixations that fall within their boundaries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Cities with low cycling maturity (LCM) are cities with a small cycling modal share and little cycling infrastructure. Despite the increasing public interest in cycling as travel mode, LCM cities are still prevalent in the western world, and few research has been developed on which are the barriers and what lead people to bicycle in this type of cities, that still are changing. This research explores the motivators and deterrents to bicycle in Lisbon (Portugal), a city with a cycling modal share below 1\%, and compares the perceived barriers to cycling between cyclists and non-cyclists, as well as the triggers and motivators to start cycling between the same groups. Results from a survey (n = 1079) showed that both groups considered the issues related to the perception of safety, physical effort, the lack of a safe cycling network, and bicycle ownership as important barriers to take up cycling in Lisbon. We conclude that non-cyclists’ perceived barriers are similar to the barriers cyclists had before they changed behavior. In contrast, the self-reported triggers that induced cyclists to take up cycling are not similar to the expectations that non-cyclists have of what would, or could, change their behavior. Nevertheless, the expected motivators stated by non-cyclists are consistent with their perceived barriers, which are more community-oriented and not so much related to personal interests or needs. We analyzed the triggers for cycling for different generations of cyclists, taking into consideration specific public policies and infrastructure investments that promote bicycling. Triggers vary over time, and they should also change as cities transition to higher cycling maturity levels. This research and conclusions may support the design of policies in order to increase cycling levels in LCM cities by acknowledging the barriers and motivations of potential new cyclists and learn from current cyclists.},

On the upside, these social resources provide a multitude of opportunities for interaction; on the downside, they often broadcast more options than can be pursued, given practical restrictions and limited time. This dual nature of social media has driven popular interest in the concept of Fear of Missing Out - popularly referred to as FoMO. Defined as a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent, FoMO is characterized by the desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing. The present research presents three studies conducted to advance an empirically based understanding of the fear of missing out phenomenon. The first study collected a diverse international sample of participants in order to create a robust individual differences measure of FoMO, the Fear of Missing Out scale (FoMOs); this study is the first to operationalize the construct. Study 2 recruited a nationally representative cohort to investigate how demographic, motivational and well-being factors relate to FoMO. Study 3 examined the behavioral and emotional correlates of fear of missing out in a sample of young adults.

This study assessed the travel time implications of hypothetically substituting actual car trips with cycling. The car trips were captured over several weeks for 178 motorists in Sydney, Australia, through Global Positioning System technology. The cycling trips were generated with reverse geocoding processes in geographic information system software. This process took into account the impacts of terrain on cycling travel times. Both individual trips and trip chains were considered. Results suggested that for an inexperienced adult cyclist more than 90\% of car trips of up to 5 km (58\% of trips) could be cycled within 10 min of the time taken by car. As the level of cycling experience increased, the bikeable distance increased: the majority of commuter adults could cycle the median commuting distance in Sydney of 11 km with little additional travel time compared with a car. For trip chains, although the competitiveness of cycling decreased as more legs were included, the total distance of the chain emerged as a more crucial issue. Cycling was found to be as competitive for trip chains shorter than 10 km as for individual shorter trips. Finally, results showed that in the context of daily travel time budgets, approximately 20\% of people could switch totally from cars to bicycles without incurring more than a 20-min additional increase in travel time on average per day.},

	abstract = {Real time data collection in traffic engineering is crucial for better traffic corridor control and management. In the literature, many data collection methods have been used such as; magnetic loops, road tube counters, piezo sensors, radars, Bluetooth etc. to estimate the link occupancy, average speed or density of a corridor. More recently, Floating Car Data (FCD) has become another important traffic data source and has an increasing usage due to its lower cost and higher coverage despite its reliability problems. FCD obtained from GPS equipped vehicles moving in the traffic can provide speed or travel speed data for many segments for even 1-min intervals in real-time. Though not totally diverse providing more than one of the traffic flow parameters, measuring the effectiveness of this extensive data source in detecting some critical urban traffic states is the ultimate goal of this study. As a case study, 1-min interval FCD for an urban arterial in Ankara has been collected during the morning peak hour for 2 months. Average speed values were transformed into a qualitative 4-scale state parameter based on the Level of Service (LOS) definitions for urban roads. Pattern searches over consecutive segment states using different search length (i.e. 2 segments, 3 segments, etc.) showed that FCD is capable to detect recurrent congestion or bottleneck locations, and even have an idea about the length of queue formed before the bottlenecks.},

This article presents an approach for urban transport sustainability performance evaluation using fuzzy logic. This article presents a model for transport sustainability performance evaluation.

The model addresses all major dimensions of transport sustainability such as Economic Sustainability, Social Sustainability, Environmental Sustainability and Transportation System Effectiveness. Transport sustainability index has been computed as (5.05, 6.62, 8.12) and weaker transport sustainability attributes were found. Transport sustainability index highlights the question how far toward becoming transport sustainable is an enterprise or region? While, weaker transport sustainability attributes reveals that how can an enterprise or region improve its transport sustainability effectively? Appropriate actions were initiated to improve urban transport sustainability performance. The results indicate that the model is capable of effectively assessing transport sustainability and has practical relevance. An example is also used to illustrate the approach developed. The results obtained using fuzzy approach has been validated with conventional crisp approach. 20 transport sustainability attributes out of 60 are found to be weaker and appropriate actions were derived to improve the weaker attributes.},

In The Discovery of Grounded Theory, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss address the equally Important enterprise of how the discovery of theory from data-systematically obtained and analyzed in social research-can be furthered. The discovery of theory from data-grounded theory-is a major task confronting sociology, for such a theory fits empirical situations, and is understandable to sociologists and laymen alike. Most important, it provides relevant predictions, explanations, interpretations, and applications. In Part I of the book, "Generation Theory by Comparative Analysis," the authors present a strategy whereby sociologists can facilitate the discovery of grounded theory, both substantive and formal. This strategy involves the systematic choice and study of several comparison groups. In Part II, The Flexible Use of Data," the generation of theory from qualitative, especially documentary, and quantitative data Is considered. In Part III, "Implications of Grounded Theory," Glaser and Strauss examine the credibility of grounded theory. The Discovery of Grounded Theory is directed toward improving social scientists' capacity for generating theory that will be relevant to their research. While aimed primarily at sociologists, it will be useful to anyone Interested In studying social phenomena-political, educational, economic, industrial- especially If their studies are based on qualitative data.},

The empirical basis of the article is a case study of Tysons Corner, Virginia-perhaps the archetypal "edge city"-and contemporary deliberations over its future development. An edge city like Tysons Corner has been the focus for the suburban 'growth machine' driving the urbanization of the United States but may now be the subject of distinctly postsuburban political dynamics that resemble a developmental regime.

This paper reports on a longitudinal study examining the impacts of the still in progress ‘mini-Hollands programme’, which seeks to transform local environments for walking and cycling, in three Outer London boroughs. Compared to Inner London, Outer London has low levels of cycling and low levels of walking, and is relatively car dependent. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study of 1712 individuals sampled from households in mini-Holland boroughs (intervention sample) and from non mini-Holland Outer London boroughs (control sample). The intervention sample was further divided, a priori, into those living in “high-dose neighbourhoods”, where substantial changes to the local walking and cycling infrastructure had been implemented, versus “low-dose neighbourhoods” where such improvements had not (yet) been made. At both baseline (2016) and one-year follow-up (2017), we administered an online survey of travel behaviour and attitudes to transport and the local environment. Results: One year's worth of interventions was associated with an increase in active travel among those living in areas defined as ‘high-dose’ neighbourhoods. Specifically, those in high-dose areas were 24\% more likely to have done any past-week cycling at follow-up, compared to those living in non mini-Holland areas (95\% CI, 2\% to 52\%). The mid-point estimate for increase in active travel (walking plus cycling) time for the same group was an additional 41.0 min (95\% CI 7.0, 75.0 min). Positive changes in views about local environments were recorded in intervention areas, driven by a perceived improvement in cycling-related items. Controversy related to the interventions is expressed in a growth in perceptions that ‘too much’ money is spent on cycling in intervention areas. However, intervention areas also saw a reduction in perceptions that ‘too little’ money is spent (the latter view being common both at baseline and Wave 1 in control areas). Conclusion: Overall, the findings here suggest that programme interventions, while controversial, are having a measurable and early impact on active travel behaviour and perceptions of the local cycling environment.},

	abstract = {The conversion of Earth's land surface to urban uses is one of the most irreversible human impacts on the global biosphere. It drives the loss of farmland, affects local climate, fragments habitats, and threatens biodiversity. Here we present a meta-analysis of 326 studies that have used remotely sensed images to map urban land conversion. We report a worldwide observed increase in urban land area of 58,000 km 2 from 1970 to 2000. India, China, and Africa have experienced the highest rates of urban land expansion, and the largest change in total urban extent has occurred in North America. Across all regions and for all three decades, urban land expansion rates are higher than or equal to urban population growth rates, suggesting that urban growth is becoming more expansive than compact. Annual growth in GDP per capita drives approximately half of the observed urban land expansion in China but only moderately affects urban expansion in India and Africa, where urban land expansion is driven more by urban population growth. In high income countries, rates of urban land expansion are slower and increasingly related to GDP growth. However, in North America, population growth contributes more to urban expansion than it does in Europe. Much of the observed variation in urban expansion was not captured by either population, GDP, or other variables in the model. This suggests that contemporary urban expansion is related to a variety of factors difficult to observe comprehensively at the global level, including international capital flows, the informal economy, land use policy, and generalized transport costs. Using the results from the global model, we develop forecasts for new urban land cover using SRES Scenarios. Our results show that by 2030, global urban land cover will increase between 430,000 km 2 and 12,568,000 km 2, with an estimate of 1,527,000 km 2 more likely. © 2011 Seto et al.},

By using a tour-based modeling framework and highly detailed land use and travel data, this study attempts to add detail on the specific land use changes necessary to address different types of travel, and to develop a comparative framework by which the relative impact of travel time and urban form changes can be assessed. A discrete choice modeling framework adjusted for demographic factors and assessed the relative effect of travel time, costs, and urban form on mode choice and trip chaining characteristics for the three tour types. The tour based modeling approach increased the ability to understand the relative contribution of urban form, time, and costs in explaining mode choice and tour complexity for home and work related travel. Urban form at residential and employment locations, and travel time and cost were significant predictors of travel choice. Travel time was the strongest predictor of mode choice while urban form the strongest predictor of the number of stops within a tour. Results show that reductions in highway travel time are associated with less transit use and walking. Land use patterns where respondents work predicted mode choice for mid day and journey to work travel. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

This is followed by a description of the survey methodology used in the project which forms the core of this paper. Then the evidence on why people used their cars for a set of real short trips identified in the surveys is presented. This is considered in terms of a number of dimensions including age, sex, and trip purpose. This is followed by a discussion of the alternatives to the car that drivers say that they might adopt and the factors which they say would make them consider switching to these alternatives.},

	abstract = {Introduction The aim of paper is to cluster policies of sustainable mobility in order to define an essential set of specific Transport Performance Indicators (TPI). TPIs are standardized measures suitable for analysis in order to appraise the feasibility of a transport policy or an infrastructural project. Data collection of TPIs is a crucial phase, but data detection and monitoring are not standardized at the city level. Thus, there is no a standard for data collection and storing, this aspect makes much difficult to compare different city contexts. This issue is critical and bounds the analysis of built scenarios. A standardized set of transport performance indicators becomes, hence, essential for monitoring the implemented policies. Methodology and results The paper answers to some of these questions, providing a specific set of sustainable and transport performance indicators to evaluate effects of policy measures. Furthermore, it shows a comparative analysis of different European cities in terms of development, sustainability and infrastructures, by using transport performance indicators. A Normalized Transport Sustainability Index has been built using identified TPIs, in order to measure and hence to compare the whole sustainability of adopted policies in different urban areas. The same NTSI allows to appraise the expected results and thus to tune the policy measures. Conclusion We can affirm that an high value of sustainability is associated, in general, to small-medium cities in term both population and urban area; nevertheless, for large cities, the adoption of policy measures, from a side, to control the urban sprawl, from the other side, to manage the urban transport demand with an adequate public transport development allows to achieve a more sustainable mobility. © 2011 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Transport policy decisions often involve a trade-off between travel time and safety. Transport economists generally evaluate the societal value of transport policy options involving travel time versus safety trade-offs in a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) through multiplying the expected change in traffic casualties with the value of a statistical life (VOSL) and multiplying the changes in travel time with the (marginal) value of time (VOT). The dominant empirical approach to infer the VOSL and the VOT is based on stated preference experiments in which respondents are asked to make choices between (hypothetical) routes which differ in terms of various characteristics (e.g. travel time and number of fatal accidents per year). This approach towards inferring the VOT and the VOSL has been criticized by scholars who argue that individuals’ preferences as consumer of mobility inferred through (hypothetical) route choices may be a poor proxy for how the same individuals in their role of citizen believe that government should trade-off safety and travel time. This study investigates the extent to which individuals indeed do have different preferences as consumer and citizen when trading off travel time and safety, by conducting five stated choice experiments in which respondents are asked to choose between hypothetical routes as consumer or hypothetical routes/policy options as citizen. Our results suggest that individuals in their role as citizen assign substantially more value to safety than travel time when compared to their consumer choices. We believe that this paper could fuel a debate about whether or not the VOT and VOSL inferred from choices individuals make as a car driver are the single most relevant metrics for the valuation of expected changes in traffic casualties and travel time in the appraisal of transport-related government policy options.},

	abstract = {Most cities are car-centric, allocating a privileged amount of urban space to cars at the expense of sustainable mobility like cycling. Simultaneously, privately owned vehicles are vastly underused, wasting valuable opportunities for accommodating more people in a livable urban environment by occupying spacious parking areas. Since a data-driven quantification and visualization of such urban mobility space inequality is lacking, here we explore how crowdsourced data can help to advance its understanding. In particular, we describe how the open-source online platform What the Street!? uses massive user-generated data from OpenStreetMap for the interactive exploration of city-wide mobility spaces. Using polygon packing and graph algorithms, the platform rearranges all parking and mobility spaces of cars, rails, and bicycles of a city to be directly comparable, making mobility space inequality accessible to a broad public. This crowdsourced method confirms a prevalent imbalance between modal share and space allocation in 23 cities worldwide, typically discriminating bicycles. Analyzing the guesses of the platform’s visitors about mobility space distributions, we find that this discrimination is consistently underestimated in the public opinion. Finally, we discuss a visualized scenario in which extensive parking areas are regained through fleets of shared, autonomous vehicles. We outline how such accessible visualization platforms can facilitate urban planners and policy makers to reclaim road and parking space for pushing forward sustainable transport solutions.},

Elicited items concerned perceived risk of infrastructure layouts, fear of traffic, cycling while distracted, use of safety gear, cycling avoidance due to feeling unsafe, and avoidance to cycle in mixed traffic conditions. The data were analyzed with structural equation models. Results show that, in comparison with cyclists in Copenhagen, cyclists in Brisbane perceive mixed traffic infrastructure layouts as less safe, feel more fear of traffic, and are more likely to adopt cycling avoidance as a coping strategy. Results also show that cyclists in Copenhagen tend to use less helmets and to cycle more while being distracted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. © 1991.},

In this study the actual cyclist gaze behavior while cycling on bicycle tracks—exclusive or shared with pedestrians is analyzed. The intent is to allow a better comprehension of those elements representing interferences, which can influence user's trip. Field tests were performed in the urban center of Bologna, Italy. 16 participants were asked to wear mobile eye tracking glasses and cycle along a defined route. From gaze data recorded by the mobile eye detector, we analyzed which visual information are detected. By applying fixations detection algorithm and then a frame-by-frame analysis we calculated the proportion of fixations—number and duration-across different areas of interest. Proportion of fixations and fixation time are assumed as a proxy of visual workload. Thus, the relative frequency of fixation has been used to rank those elements that draw cyclist attention. Three are the main outcomes: first, an equilibrium of attention location between the central (trajectory) and lateral parts of the visual scene can be assumed as the optimal cycling visual condition. This condition results compromised when the presence of pedestrians is high. Second, discontinuities of the path (like intersections and crosswalks) and the presence of pedestrians are the elements requiring more attention. Third, the absence of physical and visual separation between cyclists and pedestrians seems to lead to a lack of attention to these risk elements. These outcomes about cyclists’ visual behavior allowed to recommend design measures to increase comfort and safety on shared-with pedestrian-cycling paths. Thus, suggestions are addressed in the conclusions.},

	abstract = {As the number of private vehicles grows worldwide, so does air pollution and traffic congestion, which typically constrain economic development. To achieve transportation sustainability and continued economic development, the dependency on private vehicles must be decreased by increasing public transportation usage. However, without knowing the key factors that affect public transportation usage, developing strategies that effectively improve public transportation usage is impossible. Therefore, this study respectively applies global and local regression models to identify the key factors of usage rates for 348 regions (township or districts) in Taiwan. The global regression model, the Tobit regression model (TRM), is used to estimate one set of parameters that are associated with explanatory variables and explain regional differences in usage rates, while the local regression model, geographically weighted regression (GWR), estimates parameters differently depending on spatial correlations among neighbouring regions. By referencing related studies, 32 potential explanatory variables in four categories, social-economic, land use, public transportation, and private transportation, are chosen. Model performance is compared in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and spatial autocorrelation coefficient (Moran' I). Estimation results show that the GWR model has better prediction accuracy and better accommodation of spatial autocorrelation. Seven variables are significantly tested, and most have parameters that differ across regions in Taiwan. Based on these findings, strategies are proposed that improve public transportation usage.},

The research shows that these factors have different effects on people depending on the stage of change of cycling behaviour these people are in. In particular, the effects vary among people in the early stages of change of cycling behaviour (pre-contemplation and contemplation) and those in the late stages of change (action and maintenance). Importantly, results indicate that addressing physical barriers alone is likely to have little impact on encouraging bicycle commuting. More specifically, the research shows that perceived motivator variables (e.g. low bicycle price, quality of bicycle, cycling training, and direct cycling routes) are strongly associated with bicycle commuting. Physical barriers including weather, absence of safe parking at home and at work, lack of bicycle paths and water showers at work places as well as personal barriers like social status, social (in)security and not feeling comfortable on a bicycle have the most negative influence on bicycle commuting. Policy related interventions like exemption of bicycle import tax, car congestion charges, and guarding bicycles at public places have a strong impact on bicycle use. Thestudy findings provide a clear understanding of the key influencing factors which can serve as an empirical basis for development of more effective targeted measures to encourage modal change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Accurate detection of objects in 3D point clouds is a central problem in many applications, such as autonomous navigation, housekeeping robots, and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.},

Bicycle lanes were never neutral, but contested from the start. Based on comparative research of cycling history covering nine European cities in four countries, the article shows the crucial role representations of bicycles play in policymakers' and experts' planning for the future. In debating the regulation of urban traffic flows, urban-planning professionals projected separate lanes to control rather than to facilitate working- class, mass-scale bicycling. Significantly, cycling organizations opposed the lanes, while experts like traffic engineers and urban planners framed automobility as the inevitable modern future. Only by the 1970s did bicycle lanes enter the debate as safe and sustainable solutions when grass-roots cyclists' activists campaigned for them. The up and downs of bicycle lanes show the importance of encouraging everyday utility cycling by involving diverse social groups.},

A key aspect is how drivers’ behave towards uncertainties towards associated search times and finding a vacant parking spot. This study presents the results from a stated preference experiment on the choice behaviour of drivers, in light of these uncertainties. The attribute set was selected based on a literature review, and appended with the probabilities of finding a vacant parking spot upon arrival and after 8min (and initially also after 4min, but later dropped to reduce the survey complexity). Efficient Designs were used to create the survey design, where two rounds of pilot studies were conducted to estimate prior coefficients. Data was successfully collected from 397 respondents. Various random utility maximisation (RUM) choice models were estimated, including multinomial logit, nested logit, and mixed logit, as well as models accounting for panel effects. These model analyses show how drivers appear to accept spending time on searching for a vacant parking spot, where parking availability after 8min ranks second most important factor in determining drivers’ parking decisions, whilst parking availability upon arrival ranks fourth. Furthermore, the inclusion of heterogeneity in preferences and inter-driver differences is found to increase the predictive power of the parking location choice model. The study concludes with an outlook of how these insights into drivers’ parking behaviour can be incorporated into traffic assignment models and used to support parking systems.},

	abstract = {The information that a driver uses is predominantly visual, and wide ranges of specific driving behaviors, from navigation to anticipation of hazardous events, are primarily dependent on the optimum deployment of attention through overt eye movements. Essentially, eye movements consist of two primary events: fixations and saccades. Fixations are periods of relative stability, during which the eyes focus on something in the visual scene. Saccades are rapid, ballistic jumps of the eye that separate the fixations and serve to orient the focus of the eyes from one point of interest to another. The simplest conception of whether an individual has looked at a certain object in a scene is whether the eye coordinates recorded by an eye tracker are coincident with the world coordinates of the object. This can be calculated automatically for eye movements to static images, where the precise coordinates of an object are easily defined and related to the eye position coordinates. Many eye tracking software packages allow areas of interest (AOIs) to be generated for particular pictures, which allow automatic calculation of when individuals look at specific objects. These AOIs are regions of a visual image that are defined by two-dimensional (2D) coordinates in the viewing plane and thus allow the software to identify fixations that fall within their boundaries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Car-dependent city planning has resulted in high levels of environmental pollution, sedentary lifestyles and increased vulnerability to the effects of climate change. The Barcelona Superblock model is an innovative urban and transport planning strategy that aims to reclaim public space for people, reduce motorized transport, promote sustainable mobility and active lifestyles, provide urban greening and mitigate effects of climate change. We estimated the health impacts of implementing this urban model across Barcelona. Methods: We carried out a quantitative health impact assessment (HIA) study for Barcelona residents ≥20 years (N = 1,301,827) on the projected Superblock area level (N = 503), following the comparative risk assessment methodology. We 1) estimated expected changes in (a) transport-related physical activity (PA), (b) air pollution (NO2), (c) road traffic noise, (d) green space, and (e) reduction of the urban heat island (UHI) effect through heat reductions; 2) scaled available risk estimates; and 3) calculated attributable health impact fractions. Estimated endpoints were preventable premature mortality, changes in life expectancy and economic impacts. Results: We estimated that 667 premature deaths (95\% CI: 235–1,098) could be prevented annually through implementing the 503 Superblocks. The greatest number of preventable deaths could be attributed to reductions in NO2 (291, 95\% PI: 0–838), followed by noise (163, 95\% CI: 83–246), heat (117, 95\% CI: 101–137), and green space development (60, 95\% CI: 0–119). Increased PA for an estimated 65,000 persons shifting car/motorcycle trips to public and active transport resulted in 36 preventable deaths (95\% CI: 26–50). The Superblocks were estimated to result in an average increase in life expectancy for the Barcelona adult population of almost 200 days (95\% CI: 99–297), and result in an annual economic impact of 1.7 billion EUR (95\% CI: 0.6–2.8). Discussion: The Barcelona Superblocks were estimated to help reduce harmful environmental exposures (i.e. air pollution, noise, and heat) while simultaneously increase PA levels and access to green space, and thereby provide substantial health benefits. For an equitable distribution of health benefits, the Superblocks should be implemented consistently across the entire city. Similar health benefits are expected for other cities that face similar challenges of environmental pollution, climate change vulnerability and low PA levels, by adopting the Barcelona Superblock model.},

Objective The Evidence-based Software Engineering (EBSE) paradigm has been proposed in 2004 and, since then, has been used to provide detailed insights regarding different topics in software engineering research and practice. Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) are also useful in the context of EBSE by bringing together all existing evidence of research and results about a particular topic. This SLR evaluates the current state of the art of using eye-trackers in software engineering and provides evidence on the uses and contributions of eye-trackers to empirical studies in software engineering. Method We perform a SLR covering eye-tracking studies in software engineering published from 1990 up to the end of 2014. To search all recognised resources, instead of applying manual search, we perform an extensive automated search using Engineering Village. We identify 36 relevant publications, including nine journal papers, two workshop papers, and 25 conference papers. Results The software engineering community started using eye-trackers in the 1990s and they have become increasingly recognised as useful tools to conduct empirical studies from 2006. We observe that researchers use eye-trackers to study model comprehension, code comprehension, debugging, collaborative interaction, and traceability. Moreover, we find that studies use different metrics based on eye-movement data to obtain quantitative measures. We also report the limitations of current eye-tracking technology, which threaten the validity of previous studies, along with suggestions to mitigate these limitations. Conclusion However, not withstanding these limitations and threats, we conclude that the advent of new eye-trackers makes the use of these tools easier and less obtrusive and that the software engineering community could benefit more from this technology.},

Otros cuadros, a los que atribuimos mecanismos pato-génicos semejantes, son las psicosis que aparecen en rituales de exorcismo, en la hipnosis, las asociadas a prácticas como el Qi-Gong, en los éxtasis y en los trances. CASOS CLÍNICOS A continuación exponemos dos casos clínicos prototí-picos. Caso 1 S. es una paciente de 28 años en seguimiento en un Hospital de Día desde ocho meses antes de la entrevista, a raíz de un ingreso psiquiátrico por una descompensación psicótica de su enfermedad de base, siendo ésta una esqui-zofrenia tipo paranoide. Por otra parte, S. ha acrecentado su interés por la religiosidad en los últimos meses, llegando a ir a misa todos los días las últimas semanas. También ha acudi-do a sesiones de exorcismo y espiritismo alegando que siente la presencia de un espíritu maligno en su interior. A la exploración muestra una conciencia parcial de en-fermedad; refiere que la mitad de sus síntomas son debidos a la enfermedad que padece y la otra mitad a algo que ella desconoce pero que intuye que tiene una "naturaleza espi-ritual". Contactó con un sacerdote hace ocho meses a través de una página web y realizó un total de ocho sesiones de espi-ritismo con él, experimentando una notable mejoría según refiere la paciente. Describe estas sesiones como "induccio-nes al trance" en las que la incitan a relajarse y a meditar mientras el clérigo reza por ella. En sesiones presenciadas por sus familiares, éstos relatan cómo la paciente se retorcía, profería gritos y llegaba a echar espuma por la boca. Ante esta situación la familia contacta con el Hospital de Día, desde el que se comunican con el exorcista para ex-plicarle la enfermedad psicótica de S. pero éste comparte la creencia de que ella padece una posesión. Se intenta una negociación con el objetivo de encontrar solución para mi-nimizar el perjuicio que estas actividades causan en la en-fermedad de la paciente sin que ella rechace el tratamiento psiquiátrico. Durante su asistencia a la Unidad de Día S. se encuentra consciente y orientada, abordable, colaboradora, con buen aspecto. Mantiene contacto visual. Empatiza con el entre-vistador con buena resonancia afectiva. Su narración alter-na la descripción de hechos plausibles con interpretaciones y recuerdos delirantes. Destaca un notable interés por el esoterismo. Describe alucinaciones cenestopáticas como un agente que le retuerce el estómago y que entra y sale de su cuerpo. Niega tener alucinaciones auditivas en este momen-to aunque refiere haberlas tenido en el pasado. Impresiona de delirio pasional encapsulado. Sin alteraciones en la forma y en el curso del pensamiento. Caso 2 J. de 18 años, acude a urgencias de nuestro hospital traído por sus padres por alteraciones de conducta. El pa-ciente presentaba conducta desorganizada, con una gran inquietud psicomotriz, un discurso globalmente incoherente con frases inconexas y bloqueos del pensamiento. Las pocas frases que se entendían hacían alusión a compañeros que tenía en un centro dónde iba a practicar Reiki, entre otras prácticas de meditación y dónde se consumía ayahuasca en ciertas sesiones. Su afecto era inapropiado e impresionaba de síntomas psicóticos. La colaboración del paciente era escasa. En ningún momento se mostró agresivo. Su actitud parecía imprevisible pero en general era resignada. Sin an-gustia patológica.},

Yet this potential is largely untapped in the U.S., where less than 1\% of workers commute by bicycle. The problem may start as early as childhood, given a steep decline in bicycling to school among children in the U.S., particularly among high school students. This paper examines childhood and teenage experiences with and attitudes towards bicycling as seen in retrospect from adulthood. The results are drawn from a larger study that set out to explore the effect of experiences throughout life on the formation of attitudes towards bicycling. Fifty-four adult participants responded to open-ended interview questions regarding their bicycling experiences throughout their life course, starting from childhood. Results show that the way in which participants thought about bicycling changed from elementary school to high school, leading to decreased bicycling in teenage years and influencing attitudes and behavior as adults. High school students, especially females, were particularly sensitive to negative images associated with bicycling. The strong influence of social norms has important implications for policy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the last few years, they have supported numerous electric car projects which combine clean engine technologies with offers on public or shared mobility. This paper compares two ongoing public electric car services in Berlin (BeMobility) and Paris (Autolib’). We explain how both projects shape future visions of sustainable mobility and transform regional transport systems in specific ways through their performative impact as local transport policy tools. Focusing on the socio-economic and political processes through which both projects were conceived and put into practice, we explain their differences as they reflect participating actors' interests in a French versus German industrial and transport policy context after the economic crisis in 2008. We find that whereas BeMobility integrates electric cars as one element in Berlin's intermodal transport system, and thus is centred around ‘intermodality' as the central vision of sustainable transport, Autolib’ in Paris essentially reproduces the dominant mode of private passenger car transport through adding a shared electric car fleet.},

Carrying out new analysis of police injury data from 2005 to 2015, this study finds that per billion vehicle miles, motor vehicles on minor roads create more pedestrian casualties than motor vehicles on major roads. Specifically, for killed or seriously injured (KSI) casualties the rate per billion motor vehicle miles is 17\% higher on minor roads (47 against 40 KSIs per billion vehicle miles), while for slight injuries it is 66\% higher (188 against 123 slight injuries per billion vehicle miles). Examining the costs of injuries sustained, these are 7·4\% higher for pedestrians per motor vehicle mile travelled on urban minor roads, compared with major roads. For cyclists, injuries per mile driven are similar on major and minor roads. These results suggest that re-routing motor traffic to major roads in urban areas may reduce pedestrian casualties. Cyclist safety on major roads should be improved to avoid unintended negative consequences and ensure positive outcomes for cycling.},

Our comparative case study analysis is based on a wide range of statistical datasets, secondary reports, and interviews with a panel of 22 bicycling policy and planning experts. The main finding is that cycling levels in Melbourne are roughly twice as high as in Sydney and have been growing three times as fast in recent years. The difference is due to Melbourne's more favorable topography, climate, and road network as well as more supportive public policies. In particular, Melbourne has more and better integrated cycling infrastructure as well as more extensive cycling programs, advocacy, and promotional events. Melbourne also benefits from safer cycling than Sydney, which suffers from a lack of traffic-protected cycling facilities and aggressive motorist behavior toward cyclists on the road. While cycling has been increasing in Australia, it remains at very low levels relative to northern Europe, where both land use and transport policies are far more supportive of bicycling while discouraging car use through numerous restrictions and financial disincentives. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The study considered the evolution of the block and layout pattern since the initial layout was established, and its present form and performance. The findings demonstrate that certain block forms and dimensions perform better than others, in particular aspects and circumstances, and that the choice of initial block forms and sizes leads to predictable consequences and processes in subsequent development.

Two groups of bicyclists were compared: 19 frequent and 19 infrequent bicyclists. Participants were shown video clips taken with a camera attached to the handlebar of a bicycle, and they were asked to continuously indicate with a slider how much caution the situation needed. The frequent cyclists had more frequent rises in the caution estimate, which suggest that they anticipated or detected more hazards than infrequent cyclists. This is in line with the classical hazard perception results, which link the car driving experience to faster and more accurate hazard perception. The overall level or caution was not directly related to the rise event rate or bicycling frequency. Those cyclists who reported typically cycling faster than others showed elevated overall level of caution on sidewalks compared with others, but there was no difference on bike paths.},

The key to their success has been a coordinated package of mutually reinforcing transport and land-use policies that have made car use slower, less convenient, and more costly, while increasing the safety, convenience, and feasibility of walking, cycling, and public transport. The mix of policies implemented in each city has been somewhat different. The German cities have done far more to promote cycling, while Zurich and Vienna offer more public transport service per capita at lower fares. All five of the cities have implemented roughly the same policies to promote walking, foster compact mixed-use development, and discourage car use. Of the car-restrictive policies, parking management has been by far the most important. The five case study cities demonstrate that it is possible to reduce car dependence even in affluent societies with high levels of car ownership and high expectations for quality of travel.},

	abstract = {In a general mindset of 'local elaboration' of sustainable development, cities are logical loci for action: they do not only concentrate (future) consumption and production - and are hence at the origin of unsustainability 'symptoms'-, they simultaneously are the operational units in which concrete actions can be envisaged, designed, (politically) facilitated and effectively rolled out. Whenever cities engage in this innovative, ambitious and responsible task of change for integrated sustainability, an undoubtedly major amount of learning emerges; and vice versa, sound knowledge/best practices on how to proceed with local sustainability oriented change processes could be a firm support for local actors in their quest for effective and efficient action. In this paper, we present 'Urban Transition Labs' (UTL) as settings in which real life trajectories of sustainable development in cities are deployed and at the same time carefully observed; in a co-creative collaboration between actors and researchers (transdisciplinary research). Thereby, a transition management approach is applied, resulting in a cycle of five distinct phases: (a) process design and system analysis, (b) problem structuring and envisioning, (c) back casting, determining major pathways and agenda setting, (d) experimenting and (e) monitoring and evaluation. The process is guided by a 'Transition-team' that co-designs the process and feeds in relevant information to the city transition 'arenas'. These arenas are the actual initial incubators of change; they are crewed by local frontrunners that are considered as engaged visionary people with diverse backgrounds. The findings of arenas feed a further participatory process to engage the relevant city stakeholders into action. In this paper, we want to present the UTL as a potentially valuable concept to support a 'walkingthe- talk' of sustainable development by cities; and we share the first impressions on specific barriers and enablers that could determine the effectiveness of the envisaged approach. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Transportation planning is currently being confronted with a broader planning view, which is given by the concept of mobility. The Index of Sustainable Urban Mobility (I\_SUM) is among the tools developed for supporting this new concept implementation. It is a tool to assess the current mobility conditions of any city, which can also be applied for policy formulation. This study focus on the application of I\_SUM in the city of Curitiba, Brazil. Considering that the city is known worldwide as a reference of successful urban and transportation planning, the index application must confirm it. An additional objective of the study was to evaluate the index itself, or the subjacent assessment method and reference values. A global I\_SUM value of 0.747 confirmed that the city has indeed very positive characteristics regarding sustainable mobility policies. However, some deficiencies were also detected, particularly with respect to non-motorized transport modes. The application has also served to show that a few I\_SUM indicators were not able to capture some of the positive aspects of the city, what may suggest the need of changes in their formulation. Finally, the index application in parts of the city suggests that the city provides fair and equitable mobility conditions to all citizens throughout the city. This is certainly a good attribute for becoming a benchmark of sustainable mobility, even if it is not yet the ideal model.},

	abstract = {Recently, we have seen a rapid development of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based visual tracking solutions. Some trackers combine the DNN-based solutions with Discriminative Correlation Filters (DCF) to extract semantic features and successfully deliver the state-of-the-art tracking accuracy. However, these solutions are highly compute-intensive, which require long processing time, resulting unsecured real-time performance. To deliver both high accuracy and reliable real-time performance, we propose a novel tracker called SiamVGG. It combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone and a cross-correlation operator, and takes advantage of the features from exemplary images for more accurate object tracking. The architecture of SiamVGG is customized from VGG-16, with the parameters shared by both exemplary images and desired input video frames. We demonstrate the proposed SiamVGG on OTB-2013/50/100 and VOT 2015/2016/2017 datasets with the state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a decent real-time performance of 50 FPS running on a GTX 1080Ti.

	abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles can potentially emit substantially lower CO2 emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles, and so have the potential to reduce transport emissions without curtailing personal car use. Assessing the potential uptake of these new categories of vehicles requires an understanding of likely consumer responses. Previous in-depth explorations of appraisals and evaluations of electric vehicles have tended to focus on ‘early adopters’, who may not represent mainstream consumers. This paper reports a qualitative analysis of responses to electric cars, based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 40 UK non-commercial drivers (20 males, 20 females; age 24–70years) at the end of a seven-day period of using a battery electric car (20 participants) or a plug-in hybrid car (20 participants). Six core categories of response were identified: (1) cost minimisation; (2) vehicle confidence; (3) vehicle adaptation demands; (4) environmental beliefs; (5) impression management; and, underpinning all other categories, (6) the perception of electric cars generally as ‘work in progress’ products. Results highlight potential barriers to the uptake of current-generation (2010) plug-in electric cars by mainstream consumers. These include the prioritization of personal mobility needs over environmental benefits, concerns over the social desirability of electric vehicle use, and the expectation that rapid technological and infrastructural developments will make current models obsolete. Implications for the potential uptake of future electric vehicles are discussed.},

The data are collected using an internet based questionnaire that was distributed in Belgium and the Netherlands. The results show that car drivers regularly/often choose the same parking facility when visiting a central business area. In line with this finding, car drivers impute themselves as being highly habitual. A multinomial regression analysis shows that personal (gender, education, and country of residence) and trip (visit frequency) characteristics are significantly related to the distinguished habitual parking behavior levels.},

Therefore the current study compared visual search in 13 adult cyclists, when cycling a real bicycle path and while watching a ﬁlm clip of the same road. Dwell time towards ﬁve Areas of Interest (AOIs) is analysed. Dwell time (\%) in the lab and real-life was comparable only for the low quality bicycle path. Both in real-life and the lab, gaze is predominantly driven towards the road. Since gaze behaviour in the lab and reallife tends to be comparable with increasing task-complexity (road quality), it is concluded that under certain task constraints laboratory experiments making use of video clips might provide valuable information regarding gaze behaviour in real-life.},

We followed a so-called door-to-door principle, making the information between travel modes comparable. The analyses were based primarily on open data sources, and all the tools that were used to produce the data are openly available.

The fixation-based method is similar to the classic frame-by-frame method but instead of assigning frames, fixations are assigned to one of the AOIs. Although some considerable differences were found between the two methods, a Pearson correlation of 0.930 points out a good validity of the fixation-by-fixation method.

Suboptimal urban and transport planning has led to e.g. high levels of air pollution and noise, heat island effects and lack of green space and physical activity and thereby an increase in morbidity and premature mortality. How can better urban and transport planning improve public health? Methods: A narrative meta-review around a number of cutting edge and visionary studies and practices on how to improve public health through better urban and transport planning reported in the literature and from meetings over the past few years. Results: We describe the latest quantitative evidence of how cities can become healthier through better urban and transport planning. It focuses and provides evidence for important interventions, policies and actions that can improve public health, including the need for land use changes, reduce car dependency and move towards public and active transportation, greening of cities, visioning, citizen involvement, collaboration, leadership and investment and systemic approaches. Health impact assessment studies have recently provided new powerful quantitative evidence on how to make cities healthier and will be used as examples. At the same time these measures make also our cities more sustainable (i.e. carbon neutral) and liveable creating multiple benefits. Conclusion: Better urban and transport planning can lead to carbon neutral, more liveable and healthier cities, particularly through land use changes, a move from private motorised transportation to public and active transportation and greening of cities.},

	abstract = {Bicycling is one of the popular modes of transportation, but bicyclists are easily involved in injuries or fatalities in vehicle-bicycle (V-B) accidents. The AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) systems have been developed to avoid collisions, but their adaptiveness needs to be further improved under different motion patterns of V-B conflicts. This paper analyzes drivers' braking behaviors in different motion patterns of V-B conflicts to improve the performance of Bicyclist-AEB systems. For safety and data reliability, a driving simulator was used to reconstruct two typical conflict types, i.e., SCR (a bicycle crossing the road from right in front of a straight going car) and SSR (a bicycle cut-in from right in front of a straight going car). Either conflict contained various parameterized motion patterns, which were characterized by a combination of parameters: Vc (car velocity), TTC (time-to-collision), Vb (bicycle velocity), and Dlat (lateral distance between the car and the bicycle) or Vlat (maximum lateral velocity of the bicycle). Some 26 licensed drivers participated in an orthogonal experiment for braking behavior analysis. Results revealed that drivers brake immediately when V-B conflicts occur; hence the BRT (brake reaction time) is independent of any motion pattern parameters. This was further verified by another orthogonal experiment with 10 participants using the eye tracking device. BRT in SSR is longer than that in SCR due to the less perceptible risk and drivers' lower expectation of a collision. The braking intensity and brake Pedal Speed are higher in short-TTC patterns in both conflict types. Therefore, TTC is not a proper activation threshold but a reasonable indicator of braking intensity and Pedal Speed for driver-adaptive AEB systems. By applying the findings in the Bicyclist-AEB, the adaptiveness and acceptability of Bicyclist-AEB systems can be improved.},

	abstract = {Although cycling is a widespread form of transportation, little is known about the visual behaviour of bicycle users. This study examined whether the visual behaviour of cyclists can be explained by the two-level model of steering described for car driving, and how it is influenced by cycling speed and lane width. In addition, this study investigated whether travel fixations, described during walking, can also be found during a cycling task. Twelve adult participants were asked to cycle three 15 m long cycling lanes of 10, 25 and 40 cm wide at three different self-selected speeds (i.e., slow, preferred and fast). Participants' gaze behaviour was recorded at 50 Hz using a head mounted eye tracker and the resulting scene video with overlay gaze cursor was analysed frame by frame. Four types of fixations were distinguished: (1) travel fixations, (2) fixations inside the cycling lane (path), (3) fixations to the final metre of the lane (goal), and (4) fixations outside of the cycling lane (external). Participants were found to mainly watch the path (41\%) and goal (40\%) region while very few travel fixations were made ({\textless}5\%). Instead of travel fixations, an OptoKinetic Nystagmus was revealed when looking at the near path. Large variability between subjects in fixation location suggests that different strategies were used. Wider lanes resulted in a shift of gaze towards the end of the lane and to external regions, whereas higher cycling speeds resulted in a more distant gaze behaviour and more travel fixations. To conclude, the two-level model of steering as described for car driving is not fully in line with our findings during cycling, but the assumption that both the near and the far region is necessary for efficient steering seems valid. A new model for visual behaviour during goal directed locomotion is presented. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated on the predicted and measured pixels' greyscale values. A relatively high correlation was obtained, indicating that the saliency maps can be used as reliable predictions of the human observation pattern and thus can predict which elements in a landscape will catch the attention. These findings are useful in visual impact assessment, a step in the planning process which is often not well elaborated or even skipped. Saliency maps could, for instance, be used to compare the conspicuity of different designs of a construction when simulated in photographs of the original landscape. As the visual impact of an object is reduced when its visual perception decreases, the least salient design will also have the lowest visual impact and will correspond to the best integration into the existing landscape. This method is easy and produces an objective measure of the degree of visual impact. However, as slight differences in correlation depending on the degree of urbanisation of the landscape were found, this methodology will not be equally reliable in all types of landscapes. Predictions of the viewing pattern in rural landscapes with a limited amount of buildings have been demonstrated to be most reliable. In more urbanised landscapes this reliability slightly decreases but nevertheless remains significant.},

Unlike other verification problems, it needs to model minute but critical details between genuine and forged signatures, because a skilled falsification might only differ from a real signature by some specific kinds of deformation. This verification task is even harder in writer independent scenarios which is undeniably fiscal for realistic cases. In this paper, we model an offline writer independent signature verification task with a convolutional Siamese network. Siamese networks are twin networks with shared weights, which can be trained to learn a feature space where similar observations are placed in proximity. This is achieved by exposing the network to a pair of similar and dissimilar observations and minimizing the Euclidean distance between similar pairs while simultaneously maximizing it between dissimilar pairs. Experiments conducted on cross-domain datasets emphasize the capability of our network to handle forgery in different languages (scripts) and handwriting styles. Moreover, our designed Siamese network, named SigNet, provided better results than the state-of-the-art results on most of the benchmark signature datasets.},

Neglecting the invariance property leads to a hindrance in training the Siamese networks. To alleviate this issue, we propose two Riemannian structures and generalize a well-established accelerated stochastic gradient descent method to take into account the proposed Riemannian structures.

	abstract = {Walking and cycling can make a considerable contribution to sustainable transport goals, building healthier and more sustainable communities and contributing to traffic and pollution reduction. There have been many national and local initiatives to promote walking and cycling, but without a long term vision and consistent strategy it is difficult to see how a significant change may be achieved. This paper presents three alternative visions for the role of walking and cycling in urban areas for the year 2030: each vision illustrates a 'desirable' walking- and cycling-oriented transport system against a different 'exogenous social background'. These visions have been developed through a process of expert discussion and review and are intended to provide a stimulus for debate on the potential for and desirability of such alternative futures. Each is based on the UK and represents a substantial change to the current situation: in particular, each of the visions presents a view of a society where walking and cycling are considerably more important than is currently the case and where these modes cater for a much higher proportion of urban transport needs than at present. The visions show pictures of urban environments where dependence on motor vehicles has been reduced, in two of the visions to very low levels. The methodological approach for devising visions is informed by work on 'utopian thinking': a key concept underlying this approach is one of viewing the future in social constructivist terms (i.e. the future is what 'we', as a society, make it) rather than considering the future as something that can be 'scientifically' predicted by the extrapolation of current trends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Research indicates that crashes between a cyclist and a car often occur even when the cyclist must have seen the approaching car, suggesting the importance of hazard anticipation skills. This study aimed to analyze cyclists’ eye movements and crossing judgments while approaching an intersection at different speeds. Thirty-six participants watched animated video clips with a car approaching an uncontrolled four-way intersection and continuously indicated whether they would cross the intersection first. We varied (1) car approach scenario (passing, colliding, stopping), (2) traffic complexity (one or two approaching cars), and (3) cyclist's approach speed (15, 25, or 35 km/h). Results showed that participants looked at the approaching car when it was relevant to the task of crossing the intersection and posed an imminent hazard, and they directed less attention to the car after it had stopped or passed the intersection. Traffic complexity resulted in divided attention between the two cars, but participants retained most visual attention to the car that came from the right and had right of way. Effects of cycling speed on cyclists’ gaze behavior and crossing judgments were small to moderate. In conclusion, cyclists’ visual focus and crossing judgments are governed by situational factors (i.e., objects with priority and future collision potential), whereas cycling speed does not have substantial effects on eye movements and crossing judgments.},

	abstract = {The UK National Cycle Network (NCN) developed by the transport organisation, Sustrans, is a significant policy intervention aimed at encouraging cycling. Around half of the population is purported to live within one mile of the 20,000. km Network. Traffic-free paths (separated from the public highway away from motor traffic) form about one third of the Network but account for around 80\% of trips. The importance of NCN urban traffic-free paths in encouraging people to cycle is often assumed but despite large aggregate datasets characterising users, there is no research on the effects on the local communities which they serve. This paper presents research which aimed to identify the contribution of a typical section of NCN urban traffic-free path in encouraging cycling for everyday travel amongst a community living adjacent to this type of intervention.First, the paper outlines the characteristics of the NCN, the philosophy behind the development of urban traffic-free paths and the barriers to cycling which such interventions seek to overcome. Then findings of a controlled cross-sectional survey of two neighbourhoods in a medium size town in the English Midlands (which are demographically similar except that one is located adjacent to a section of NCN urban traffic-free cycle path intervention) are discussed.In conclusion the paper reveals that provision of NCN urban traffic-free cycle paths alone may be insufficient in encouraging a shift from car to cycling for everyday travel purposes. The data from the study corroborates evidence that suggests that a wider co-ordinated multi-faceted approach to promoting cycling is required which combines social marketing with physical measures including; wider speed restrictions in urban areas, investment in high quality segregated cycle facilities on major roads, and general land use and transport policies that 'advantage cycling' and reduce the convenience of the car. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Background: An appropriate method is required to identify how driver gaze reveals awareness of other road users. Method: We developed a recognition-based method for labeling of driver situation awareness (SA) in a vehicle with road-scene perception and eye tracking. Thirteen drivers performed 91 left turns on complex urban intersections and identified images of encountered road users among distractor images. Results: Drivers fixated within 2° for 72.8\% of relevant and 27.8\% of irrelevant road users and were able to recognize 36.1\% of the relevant and 19.4\% of irrelevant road users one min after leaving the intersection. Gaze behavior could predict road user relevance but not the outcome of the recognition task. Unexpectedly, 18\% of road users observed beyond 10° were recognized. Conclusions: Despite suboptimal psychometric properties leading to low recognition rates, our recognition task could identify awareness of individual road users during left turn maneuvers. Perception occurred at gaze angles well beyond 2°, which means that fixation locations are insufficient for awareness monitoring. Application: Findings can be used in driver attention and awareness modelling, and design of gaze-based driver support systems.},

In this study the actual cyclist gaze behavior while cycling on bicycle tracks—exclusive or shared with pedestrians is analyzed. The intent is to allow a better comprehension of those elements representing interferences, which can influence user's trip. Field tests were performed in the urban center of Bologna, Italy. 16 participants were asked to wear mobile eye tracking glasses and cycle along a defined route. From gaze data recorded by the mobile eye detector, we analyzed which visual information are detected. By applying fixations detection algorithm and then a frame-by-frame analysis we calculated the proportion of fixations—number and duration-across different areas of interest. Proportion of fixations and fixation time are assumed as a proxy of visual workload. Thus, the relative frequency of fixation has been used to rank those elements that draw cyclist attention. Three are the main outcomes: first, an equilibrium of attention location between the central (trajectory) and lateral parts of the visual scene can be assumed as the optimal cycling visual condition. This condition results compromised when the presence of pedestrians is high. Second, discontinuities of the path (like intersections and crosswalks) and the presence of pedestrians are the elements requiring more attention. Third, the absence of physical and visual separation between cyclists and pedestrians seems to lead to a lack of attention to these risk elements. These outcomes about cyclists’ visual behavior allowed to recommend design measures to increase comfort and safety on shared-with pedestrian-cycling paths. Thus, suggestions are addressed in the conclusions.},

This paper presents results of an interview study with 30 users of an automated shuttle on the EUREF (Europäisches Energieforum) campus in Berlin-Schöneberg to obtain in-depth understanding of the acceptance of automated shuttles as feeders to public transport systems. From the interviews, we identified 340 quotes, which were classified into six categories: (1) expectations about the capabilities of the automated shuttle (10\% of quotes), (2) evaluation of the shuttle performance (10\%), (3) service quality (34\%), (4) risk and benefit perception (15\%), (5) travel purpose (25\%), and (6) trust (6\%). The quotes indicated that respondents had idealized expectations about the technological capabilities of the automated shuttle, which may have been fostered by the media. Respondents were positive about the idea of using automated shuttles as feeders to public transport systems but did not believe that the shuttle will allow them to engage in cognitively demanding activities such as working. Furthermore, 20\% of respondents indicated to prefer supervision of shuttles via an external control room or steward on board over unsupervised automation. In conclusion, even though the current automated shuttle did not live up to the respondents’ expectations, respondents still perceived automated shuttles as a viable option for feeders to public transport systems.},

To help explain changes in daily travel patterns after a long distance move between cities the concept of urban mobility cultures is introduced. This comprehensive approach integrates objective and subjective elements of urban mobility, such as urban form and socio-economics on the one hand, and lifestyle orientations and mode preferences on the other, within one socio-technical framework. Empirically, the study is based on a survey conducted among people who recently moved between the German cities Bremen, Hamburg and the Ruhr area. Bivariate analyses and linear multiple regression models are applied to analyze changes in car, rail-based and bicycle travel. This is done by integrating variables that account for urban mobility cultures and controlling for urban form, residential preferences and socio-demographics. A central finding of this study is, that changes in the use of the car and rail-based travel are much more dependent on local scale, such as neighborhood type and residential preferences, whereas cycling is more affected by city-wide attributes, which we addressed as mobility culture elements.},

These are the failure to account for the benefits of open space, excessive commuting because of a failure to account for the social costs of congestion, and failure to make new development pay for the infrastructure costs it generates. Precise remedies for these market failures are two types of development taxes and congestion tolls levied on commuters. Each of these remedies leads to a reduction in the spatial size of the city.},

Using an inductive research design, we explored how these process related issues play out in Dutch planning practices. In two applied research techniques, focus group sessions and open in depth interviews, we focused on process related issues as perceived by CBA participants ranging from plan makers to CBA testers. This article presents the different perceptions of issues in CBA processes. Through these collected perspectives, we found that these issues are multi-layered and present a number of fundamental dilemmas.

However, some important aspects remain underexplored. One of them is the study of cycling speeds. The first goal of this research is to analyze the impact of a wide range of factor on cyclists’ speeds. Based on the examination of thousands of GPS routes, the investigation conducts diverse OLS regressions in order to analyze cyclists’ speed according to the diverse local factors that affect cyclists along their journey, such as the slope, the existence–and type–of bike infrastructures, the average traffic speed or the density of traffic lights or intersections. Cycling speed is also analyzed according to cyclists’ gender or age, the purpose of the journey, or even the weather conditions. The research includes the analysis of regular cyclists’ trips, as well as the analysis of bike-messengers’ routes. The results obtained shed light on the influence of these factors on cyclists’ speed by quantifying their specific impact, and diverse models predict cyclists’ travel times in the current scenario but also in future ones that may correspond to the implementation of new infrastructure or policies. In addition, the models allowed us to pursue the second goal of this study: to conduct a comparative analysis of accessibility for different transport modes, and then evaluate the competitiveness between them. The results evidence that cycling is not only a sustainable transport mode, but the most competitive for small-medium distances.},

An extensive literature review reveals that the academic field of transport and mobility is organized around a hegemonic core of “neoclassical” and “sustainable” approaches. Meanwhile, a critique of these dominant approaches is emerging in an attempt to (re)embed mobility issues in urban political economy. This threefold knowledge typology visibly resonates within transport policy agendas in Brussels, where we detect a growth-oriented and largely depoliticized dual hegemony of neoclassical and sustainable narratives, with critical academic voices rarely entering official agendas. The paper concludes with a reflection on the difficulties, yet also the need to mobilize critical academic knowledge in the field of transport and mobility.},

The analysis relies on national aggregate data as well as case studies of large and small cities in each country. The key to achieving high levels of cycling appears to be the provision of separate cycling facilities along heavily travelled roads and at intersections, combined with traffic calming of most residential neighbourhoods. Extensive cycling rights of way in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are complemented by ample bike parking, full integration with public transport, comprehensive traffic education and training of both cyclists and motorists, and a wide range of promotional events intended to generate enthusiasm and wide public support for cycling. In addition to their many pro-bike policies and programmes, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany make driving expensive as well as inconvenient in central cities through a host of taxes and restrictions on car ownership, use and parking. Moreover, strict land-use policies foster compact, mixed-use developments that generate shorter and thus more bikeable trips. It is the coordinated implementation of this multi-faceted, mutually reinforcing set of policies that best explains the success of these three countries in promoting cycling. For comparison, the article portrays the marginal status of cycling in the UK and the USA, where only about 1\% of trips are by bike.},

	abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions -density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the '3Ds' affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing 'walking quality' was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

I highlight contributions of the MLP to transport and sustainability modelling and social research including providing a more integrated and systemic perspective on socio-technical change. The MLP has also been useful as an analytical tool for identifying and engaging with diverse stakeholder groups, including mainstream ('regime') and alternative ('niche') organisations. The MLP might be improved by integrating natural, behavioural and political science insights, and particularly by elucidating how behavioural-institutional change might occur. This is critical for transport research given the expressed and observed public resistance to changing travel behaviour. It remains to be seen whether the MLP and transitions framework themselves require more radical adjustment to be able to predict the changes needed to support a transition to a sustainable society. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The information that a driver uses is predominantly visual, and wide ranges of specific driving behaviors, from navigation to anticipation of hazardous events, are primarily dependent on the optimum deployment of attention through overt eye movements. Essentially, eye movements consist of two primary events: fixations and saccades. Fixations are periods of relative stability, during which the eyes focus on something in the visual scene. Saccades are rapid, ballistic jumps of the eye that separate the fixations and serve to orient the focus of the eyes from one point of interest to another. The simplest conception of whether an individual has looked at a certain object in a scene is whether the eye coordinates recorded by an eye tracker are coincident with the world coordinates of the object. This can be calculated automatically for eye movements to static images, where the precise coordinates of an object are easily defined and related to the eye position coordinates. Many eye tracking software packages allow areas of interest (AOIs) to be generated for particular pictures, which allow automatic calculation of when individuals look at specific objects. These AOIs are regions of a visual image that are defined by two-dimensional (2D) coordinates in the viewing plane and thus allow the software to identify fixations that fall within their boundaries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {There is a strong interest among policy makers in measures intended to rationalize private car use. However, this requires prior assessment of the likely impact on car and public transport demand associated with each policy option. For example, what is the likely effect of a reduction of travel time by public transport on mode choice? Such effects can be quantified as elasticities, defining the percentage change in a response variable to a 1\% change in an independent variable. The aim of this study is to provide a quantitative overview of the impact of travel time, its components, and its derivatives on transit demand. Data were used from a Belgian mobility survey that was supplemented with a database with a calculated public transport trip for each trip in the mobility survey, with the use of search engines and timetables from the public transport companies. Various functional models were applied to derive demand elasticities. An evaluation of these calculated travel times with public transport search engines shows considerable but reasonable differences with observed trips. Travel time ratios, comparing car and transit travel times, and generalized time estimations, weighting walking and waiting times, offer the best approach to identify the relation between travel time and transit use and result in strongly negative elasticities, particularly when captive travelers are separated. The study contributes to the discussion on the effect of travel time on public transport demand not by using a transport model but by using a survey and transit timetable information.},

It will be argued on ontological and epistemological grounds that it is inherently impossible to make exact predictions about the magnitude of the 'general' traffic growth 20–30 years ahead, since many of the influencing factors depend on inherently unpredictable geopolitical trajectories as well as contested political decision-making. Due to the context-dependency of each par-ticular planning situation, it is also hardly possible to make exact, quan-titative predictions about the impact of implementing a specific infra-structure project, compared to 'doing nothing'. Instead of relying on traffic model simulations as the general forecasting and assessment tool in transport planning, we propose to separate the so-called strategic, tac-tical and operational levels of traffic forecasting into three distinct meth-odological approaches reflecting the different degrees of openness/ closure of the systems at hand: scenario analyses at the strategic level; theory-informed, mainly qualitative analyses supplemented with simple calculations at the tactical level; while more traditional micro-simulations should be applied only at a detailed operational level.},

Both in real-life and the lab, gaze is predominantly driven towards the road.

In the interests of promoting effective collaboration among the transportation, planning, and health fields, the current paper was written to fulfill three purposes. The first purpose was to summarize the transportation and planning studies on the relation between community design and non-motorized ("active") transport and to interpret these studies from a health perspective. The second purpose was to summarize studies from the health literature that examine the relation between physical environmental variables and leisure-time physical activity that have relevance for transportation research. The third purpose was to promote more collaboration among transportation, planning, and health investigators by identifying opportunities for transdisciplinary research. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Die These ist, dass auf einer sozialpsychologischen Ebene die Werte der Universalität und des organisierten Skeptizismus Offenheit gegenüber allem relevanten Wissen suggerieren, das wird übersetzt in Interdisziplinarität auf einem programmatischen Level, gleichbedeutend mit Innovation das ist eine Ambivalenz von Wissenschaft, denn normalerweise verläuft die Produktion von Wissen nach einer anderen Strategie: man schaut sich nach einer Nische um so werden immer neue und feinere Strukturen etabliert Aber was bringt die Wissenschaftspolitik dazu, auf Transdisziplinarität zu setzen? Deren Motive müssen unterschiedlich sein Der Interdisziplinaritäts-Diskurs ist ein Diskurs über Innovation der Wissensproduktion Die Hoffnung für Innovation liegt in der Zukunft, aber die Zukunft ist unbekannt und unstrukturiert das könnte einiges der Hoffnungen erklären, die auf Interdisziplinarität projiziert werden Deklarationen von Wissenschaftern über die wünschenswerte transdisziplinäre Forschung können nicht für bare Münze genommen werden, auch kann nicht erwartet werden, dass normative Appelle das Verhalten der Wissenschafter ändern wird. Man kann das hingegen als Opportunismus in der Suche nach Neuem, kontrolliert von Standards und Kompetenzen, betrachten Interdisziplinarität als Formen der Forschungsorganisation: In den meisten Forschungsprogrammen, die Interdisziplinarität fordern und fördern, wird kaum systematisch kontrolliert, ob das tatsächlich passiert z.B. erzählte ein Insider auf einer Konferenz dass bei einem solchen Progamm nur 20\% der Projekte tatsächlich interdisziplinär waren, das ist weniger als im Standardforschungsprogramm wo keine Interdisziplinarität gefordert ist das kann so interpretiert werden, dass Interdisziplinarität dem Opportunismus des Antragschreibens dient oder dass es einfach nur problemspezifische und problemgesteuerte Wissenskomplexe meint meist bleibt es ein rein formales Label, das vor allem ein Organisationsprinzip ist aus der Sicht der Forschungsprogramme ist Interdisziplinarität v.a. von politischen Zielen und Legitimationserfordernissen motiviert unter Umständen von limitierten Ressourcen und Legitimationsdruck werden Wissenschafter Problemdefinitionen und Labels erfinden, die zu den Erwartungen der Öffentlichkeit und der Politik passen trotz allem muss eine gewisse Struktur vorhanden sein und auch interdisziplinäre Forschung hat ihre blinden Flecken der Unterschied zwischen disziplinärer und interdisziplinärer Forschung liegt nicht in einer größeren Nähe zur Realität sondern in anderen sozialen Umständen der Forschung auch interdisziplinäre Forschung hält sich an die grundsätzlichen Regeln der Wissensproduktion der Schlüssel liegt darin, dass man Interdisziplinarität mit Innovation assoziiert: man kann Innovation nicht willentlich erzeugen, man kann nur die Umstände der Wissenserzeugung so beeinflussen, dass ein kreatives Umfeld entsteht so gesehen ist Interdisziplinarität ein anderer Weg zu sagen, dass man wissenschaftliche Innovation durch freies Fließen von Opportunismus in der Wissensproduktion organisieren möchte um Innovation zuzulassen, müssen organisationale Strukturen flexibel und diversifiziert gehalten werden insofern sind Interdisziplinarität und Spezialisierung parallele Entwicklungen},

	abstract = {Background Increasing urban bicycling has established net benefits for human and environmental health. Questions remain about which policies are needed and in what order, to achieve an increase in cycling while avoiding negative consequences. Novel ways of considering cycling policy are needed, bringing together expertise across policy, community and research to develop a shared understanding of the dynamically complex cycling system. In this paper we use a collaborative learning process to develop a dynamic causal model of urban cycling to develop consensus about the nature and order of policies needed in different cycling contexts to optimise outcomes. Methods We used participatory system dynamics modelling to develop causal loop diagrams (CLDs) of cycling in three contrasting contexts: Auckland, London and Nijmegen. We combined qualitative interviews and workshops to develop the CLDs. We used the three CLDs to compare and contrast influences on cycling at different points on a “cycling trajectory” and drew out policy insights. Results The three CLDs consisted of feedback loops dynamically influencing cycling, with significant overlap between the three diagrams. Common reinforcing patterns emerged: growing numbers of people cycling lifts political will to improve the environment; cycling safety in numbers drives further growth; and more cycling can lead to normalisation across the population. By contrast, limits to growth varied as cycling increases. In Auckland and London, real and perceived danger was considered the main limit, with added barriers to normalisation in London. Cycling congestion and “market saturation” were important in the Netherlands. Conclusions A generalisable, dynamic causal theory for urban cycling enables a more ordered set of policy recommendations for different cities on a cycling trajectory. Participation meant the collective knowledge of cycling stakeholders was represented and triangulated with research evidence. Extending this research to further cities, especially in low-middle income countries, would enhance generalizability of the CLDs.},

The move to cloud computing is no longer merely a topic of discussion; it has become a core competency that every modern business needs to embrace and excel at. It has changed the way enterprise and internet computing is viewed, and this success story is the result of the long-term efforts of computing research community around the globe. It is predicted that by 2026 more than two-thirds of all enterprises across the globe will be entirely run in cloud. These predictions have led to huge levels of funding for research and development in cloud computing and related technologies. Accordingly, universities across the globe have incorporated cloud computing and its related technologies in their curriculum, and information technology (IT) organizations are accelerating their skill-set evolution in order to be better prepared to manage emerging technologies and public expectations of the cloud, such as new services.},

	abstract = {Hazard and risk perception has been studied extensively among car drivers, and their link to crash involvement is established. Bicyclists, in particular, are vulnerable road users. Better understanding of their risk and hazard perception could help to improve their traffic safety. In this study, we investigated the risk perception of bicyclists in a city environment. Two groups of bicyclists were compared: 19 frequent and 19 infrequent bicyclists. Participants were shown video clips taken with a camera attached to the handlebar of a bicycle, and they were asked to continuously indicate with a slider how much caution the situation needed. The frequent cyclists had more frequent rises in the caution estimate, which suggest that they anticipated or detected more hazards than infrequent cyclists. This is in line with the classical hazard perception results, which link the car driving experience to faster and more accurate hazard perception. The overall level or caution was not directly related to the rise event rate or bicycling frequency. Those cyclists who reported typically cycling faster than others showed elevated overall level of caution on sidewalks compared with others, but there was no difference on bike paths.},

	abstract = {The way we talk about complex and abstract ideas is suffused with metaphor. In five experiments, we explore how these metaphors influence the way that we reason about complex issues and forage for further information about them. We find that even the subtlest instantiation of a metaphor (via a single word) can have a powerful influence over how people attempt to solve social problems like crime and how they gather information to make "well-informed" decisions. Interestingly, we find that the influence of the metaphorical framing effect is covert: people do not recognize metaphors as influential in their decisions; instead they point to more "substantive" (often numerical) information as the motivation for their problem-solving decision. Metaphors in language appear to instantiate frame-consistent knowledge structures and invite structurally consistent inferences. Far from being mere rhetorical flourishes, metaphors have profound influences on how we conceptualize and act with respect to important societal issues. We find that exposure to even a single metaphor can induce substantial differences in opinion about how to solve social problems: differences that are larger, for example, than pre-existing differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans. © 2011 Thibodeau, Boroditsky.},

This paper reports on two phases of research, resulting in the examination of over 70 case studies of roadspace reallocation from eleven countries, and the collation of opinions from over 200 transport professionals worldwide. The findings suggest that predictions of traffic problems are often unnecessarily alarmist, and that, given appropriate local circumstances, significant reductions in overall traffic levels can occur, with people making a far wider range of behavioural responses than has traditionally been assumed. Follow-up work has also highlighted the importance of managing how schemes are perceived by the public and reported in the media, with various lessons for avoiding problems. Finally, the findings highlight that well-designed schemes to reallocate roadspace can often contribute to a multiplicity of different policy aims and objectives.},
